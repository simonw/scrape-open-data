The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nThe LiDar used was a 5 meter grid system.  LiDar has an accuracy of ? cm horizontally/vertically.  Bare Earth LiDar was used in for this model surface.  \r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\n\r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nThese maps are a visual representation and intended to be used when prioritization of the best engineering solutions that are scheduled to be brought forward to Utility Council to mitigate future flooding in the City.  The best engineering solutions are high level concept designs and require further modeling and design.  At the time of the PDF release, November 9, 2016 there was no funding for any projects to be completed or for further design.  Strategy will be brought forward to Utility Committee on June 7, 2017.  Council will be determining funding and rate of project completion.  \r\nThe Storm size used in these models are larger than", "attribution": "EPCOR", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-07-29T21:08:49.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T19:01:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-29T21:08:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-04-03T19:01:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["_area", "depth", "Red", "layer", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["area", "depth", "red", "layer", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-04-03T19:01:18.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "environment", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Externally Sourced Datasets", "domain_tags": ["flood mitigation", "ponding", "ponding depth", "surcharge", "surcharge depth"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Time-Frame_Date-Made-Public", "value": "May 26, 2017"}, {"key": "Time-Frame_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not Updated (Historical Only)"}, {"key": "Time-Frame_Period-of-Coverage", "value": "2014"}, {"key": "Time-Frame_Automated-or-Manual", "value": "Manual"}, {"key": "Spatial_Coordinate-System", "value": "LL-WGS84"}, {"key": "Dataset-Dependencies_Dataset-Name-(If-any)", "value": "2014 Flood Mitigation Study - Sanitary Surcharge Colour Raster (GeoTIFF)"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Duplicates-Removed", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Verified-for-Accuracy", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "General-Information_Primary-Dataset-or-View", "value": "Primary"}, {"key": "General-Information_Internal-or-External", "value": "External"}, {"key": "General-Information_Purpose", "value": "To better describe (visually) the areas within Edmonton and the related depth of sanitary surcharge from rainwater entering the sanitary system.

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAge Friendly Edmonton Partnership\r\nIn a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city.

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.
