Over the past decade, City policy has shifted to manage natural areas with consideration of their role within an ecological network. Today, a goal of the City is to protect, preserve and enhance a functioning ecological network throughout the city limits. This network should include lands in both the river valley and the Tablelands.\n\nTo further this goal, a model was developed in 2015 for determining environmental sensitivity scores across the entirety of the city. This model guided the collection of several digital data layers with coverage across the entire study area (including several ecological assets, threats to assets, and development and cultural constraints). Data layers were then used to develop spatial outputs that summarized the distribution of these assets, threats and constraints. These base layers have been compiled into this dataset to help inform planning, development and conservation throughout Edmonton.\n\nEnvironmental sensitivity analysis incorporated recent mapping of the ecological network of native and non-native vegetation, streams, wetlands and other waterbodies as much as possible, with practical limitations. The City\u2019s urban Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (uPLVI) and remote sensing data used for this assessment were completed in 2015 and 2013 respectively, which is relatively recent, but not current. Similarly, infrastructure data (roads, subdivision development and stormwater facilities) provided varied in month of acquisition from 2015.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T17:50:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-24T18:28:54.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:50:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:50:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Log Timestamp", "Row ID", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Direction", "Location Description", "Site ID", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Speed Range for Bin", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "log_timestamp", "row_id", "speed_unit_of_measure", "direction", "location_description", "site_id", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "speed_range_for_bin", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T18:02:52.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-08T23:27:39.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T16:54:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T18:02:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Row ID", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Log Timestamp", "Speed Limit", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Speed Range for Bin", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Bin Number", "Location Description", "Direction", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Site ID", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "row_id", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "log_timestamp", "speed_limit", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "speed_range_for_bin", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "bin_number", "location_description", "direction", "speed_unit_of_measure", "site_id", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "maximum_speed_detection_setting"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles that were successfully detected and recorded within the specified parameters.

However, the Anglo-Huron Treaty (Murray Treaty), which is part of the Treaties of Peace and Neutrality, is not represented in this dataset because it has no geographic boundary. These boundaries represent the large areas of land that the First Nations gave up to the Crown in exchange for such things as reserve lands, benefits or promises. These boundaries are usually not surveyed but help to delineate the broad area defined within the treaty. The boundaries are composed of the sum of specific geographies such as lakes, rivers, townships, mountains, administrative boundaries or height of land as mentioned in the treaties transcript. These boundaries are estimated based on written descriptions and should be used for informational and representational purposes only.\n\nThe various treaties created between the Crown and the Aboriginal people, include: the Treaties of Peace and Neutrality, the Peace and Friendship Treaties, Upper Canada Land Surrenders, the Williams Treaties, the Robinson Treaties, the Douglas Treaties and the Numbered Treaties.\n\nFor more information about Pre-1975 Treaties, visit http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370362690208/1370362747827.\n\nThe Pre-1975 Treaties dataset is part of the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information.\n\nThe Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information represent the geographic boundaries of the solemn agreements between the Crown and the Aboriginal people, and set out promises, obligations and benefits for both parties. The following datasets are also available:\n\n1) The Post-1975 Treaties (Modern Treaties) dataset represents the areas of Canada where Aboriginal land rights and title have not been addressed by treaty or through other legal means.\n\n2) The Aboriginal Agreements dataset represents established consultation processes and the Aboriginal groups that govern their internal affairs and assume greater responsibility and control over the decision making that affects their communities.\n\nData-sharing agreements with the INAC\u2019s internal groups (Negotiations Central and Implementation branch) as well as the Department of Natural Resources Canada are in place to ensure that any update to the attributes data or geography is reflected in the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information.\n\nThis dataset is Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) primary source for Pre-1975 Treaties geographic boundaries on maps.\n\nThis dataset can also be viewed in the Aboriginal and Treaty Rights Information System (ATRIS). This web-based system provides access to information to inform governments, industry and other interested parties in determining their consultation obligations and in carrying out their consultation research.\"\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014686/1100100014687.", "attribution": "Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Geomatics Services", "attribution_link": "https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/f281b150-0645-48e4-9c30-01f55f93f78e", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-13T20:07:52.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-02-25T18:48:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-13T20:07:52.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-25T18:54:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["French Name", "SBTP_FNAME", "SBTP_ENAME", "ENAME", "TAG_ID", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["fname", "sbtp_fname", "sbtp_ename", "ename", "tag_id", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-02-25T18:54:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Geospatial Boundaries", "domain_tags": ["aboriginal lands", "aboriginal peoples", "aboriginal rights", "agreements", "boundaries", "comprehensive land claim", "indigenous", "self-government", "settlement lands", "treaty"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Time-Frame_Update-Frequency", "value": "When Necessary"}, {"key": "Time-Frame_Automated-or-Manual", "value": "Automated"}, {"key": "Spatial_Coordinate-System", "value": "3TM114-83"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Duplicates-Removed", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Verified-for-Accuracy", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Story-Attributes_Internal-embed-viz", "value": "1"}, {"key": "General-Information_Primary-Dataset-or-View", "value": "View"}, {"key": "General-Information_Internal-or-External", "value": "External"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.edmonton.ca", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.edmonton.ca/d/p5gj-tysf", "link": "https://data.edmonton.ca/Geospatial-Boundaries/Pre-1975-Treaties-Historic-Treaties-/p5gj-tysf", "owner": {"id": "dhgx-s4x9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "opendata@edmonton.ca"}, "creator": {"id": "dhgx-s4x9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "opendata@edmonton.ca"}}

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T17:35:50.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-30T11:48:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:07:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:35:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Row ID", "Bin Number", "Speed Range for Bin", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Site ID", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Direction", "Log Timestamp", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit", "Location Description"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "row_id", "bin_number", "speed_range_for_bin", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "site_id", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "direction", "log_timestamp", "speed_unit_of_measure", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit", "location_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "System generated ID to eliminate the possibility of duplicate data.", "A value between 1 and 10, representing the data bin for which the vehicle count and the speed range is applicable.

As such, this version of the dataset should not be directly compared to previous versions of this dataset.\n\n* The average fire flow capacity should be used to evaluate average available fire flow in a relative manner: e.g. a blue area is anticipated to provide higher flows on average than a green area.\n\n* Any city block area that indicates 0-60 L/s fire flow capacity has been evaluated by Edmonton Fire Rescue Services (EFRS). EFRS does not associate any significant risk with these areas and can adapt a response to a fire event in these areas given the small geographical area and buildings affected.\n\n* The results presented in this data were determined using computer modelling software that represented the distribution and transmission water network current in EWSI's digital records as of March 3, 2021. Modifications to the water system after this date may change the available fire flow at any given time or place. \n\n* The results presented in this data represent the overall average system capacity of the existing EPCOR-owned fire hydrants in the area during computer-simulated fire flow conditions. Other factors may change the available fire flow at any given time or place.\n\n* The average fire flow ranges are only indicative of average system capacity and not indicative of EPCOR-owned hydrant spacing. A development may still require infrastructure upgrades to meet minimum hydrant spacing requirements.\n\n* This map is not a substitute for directed engineering inquiries regarding infrastructure improvements to support development. Please contact EPCOR Water at wtrdc@epcor.com to determine fire protection requirements for development.\n\nDataset updated 2021-10-05T10:17:09.", "attribution": "EPCOR", "attribution_link": "http://www.epcor.com", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-10-05T16:17:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-03-07T18:13:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-10-05T16:17:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-10-05T16:17:37.000Z", "columns_name": ["Hexagon ID", "year", "Average Available Fire Flow Range", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["hexagonid", "year", "avgavailffr", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["A unique number assigned to the hexagon for reference purposes.", "", "These are the ranges that contain the average of available fire flows of all EPCOR-owned hydrants within each hexagon.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T17:38:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-30T21:45:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:10:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:38:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Log Timestamp", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Direction", "Row ID", "Speed Limit", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Location Description", "Site ID", "Speed Range for Bin", "Bin Number", "Speed Unit of Measure"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "log_timestamp", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "direction", "row_id", "speed_limit", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "location_description", "site_id", "speed_range_for_bin", "bin_number", "speed_unit_of_measure"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "A flag value that indicates the following: 0 - if the both the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin are below the Speed Limit 1 - if the Speed Limit is between the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin 2 - if the value of both the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin are greater than the Speed Limit", "The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T17:30:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-16T20:46:15.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:03:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:30:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Speed Range for Bin", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Log Timestamp", "Row ID", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Bin Number", "Site ID", "Location Description", "Speed Limit", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Direction"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "speed_range_for_bin", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "log_timestamp", "row_id", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "bin_number", "site_id", "location_description", "speed_limit", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_unit_of_measure", "direction"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T17:26:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-15T14:36:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T16:59:08.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-08T17:26:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Speed Range for Bin", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Log Timestamp", "Row ID", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Bin Number", "Site ID", "Location Description", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Speed Limit", "Direction"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "speed_range_for_bin", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "log_timestamp", "row_id", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "bin_number", "site_id", "location_description", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_unit_of_measure", "speed_limit", "direction"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "A flag value that indicates the following: 0 - if the both the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin are below the Speed Limit 1 - if the Speed Limit is between the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin 2 - if the value of both the Minimum Speed and Maximum Speed for the Bin are greater than the Speed Limit", "A calculated value based on (Maximum Speed Detection Setting and Minimum Speed Detection Setting).

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAge Friendly Edmonton Partnership\r\nIn a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city.

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.
