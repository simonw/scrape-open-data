On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAge Friendly Edmonton Partnership\r\nIn a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city. These benches are specifically painted and wrapped in vinyl. Visit a bench today and make sure to say \u201cHello, How are you?\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on Buddy Benches, please go to: https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/buddy-benches.aspx", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-28T10:02:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-06-06T22:36:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-28T10:02:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-28T10:02:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Description of Exact Location", "Latitude", "Street Address", "Geometry Point", "Longitude", "Location", "Neighbourhood", "City of Edmonton - Ward Boundaries (effective at 12:00 AM on Oct 16, 2017)", "Edmonton Catholic School District Ward Boundaries (effective at 12:00 AM on Oct 16, 2017)", "Edmonton Public School Board (EPSB) Ward Boundaries (effective at 12:00 AM on Oct 16, 2017)", "Roadway Maintenance Area Polygon", "Neighbourhood Boundaries : 2019"], "columns_field_name": ["description_of_exact_location", "latitude", "street_address", "geometry_point", "longitude", "location", "neighbourhood", ":@computed_region_mnf4_kaez", ":@computed_region_5jki_au6x", ":@computed_region_izdr_ja4x", ":@computed_region_ecxu_fw7u", ":@computed_region_7ccj_gre3"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'City of Edmonton - Ward Boundaries (effective at 12:00 AM on Oct 16, 2017)' (mnf4-kaez) the point in column 'geometry_point' is located.

For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.

The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.
