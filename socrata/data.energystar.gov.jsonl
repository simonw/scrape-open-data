Integrated desktop computers come in one of two possible forms: (1) a system where the display and computer are physically combined into a single unit; or (2) a system packaged as a single system where the display is separate but is connected to the main chassis by a dc power cord and both the computer and display are powered from a single power supply.\n\nNotebook: A computer designed specifically for portability and to be operated for extended periods of time both with and without a direct connection to an ac mains power source.\n\nSlate/tablet: A computing device designed for portability.\n\nPortable All-in-one Computer: A computing device designed for limited portability.\n\nSmall-scale Server: A computer that typically uses desktop components in a desktop form factor, but is designed primarily to be a storage host for other computers. Small-scale Servers are designed to perform functions such as providing network infrastructure services (e.g., archiving) and hosting data/media.\n\nThin Client: An independently-powered computer that relies on a connection to remote computing resources to obtain primary functionality. Main computing functions (e.g., program execution, data storage, interaction with other Internet resources) are provided by the remote computing resources.\n\nWorkstation: A high-performance, single-user computer typically used for graphics, CAD, software development, financial and scientific applications among other compute intensive tasks.", "A second-order classification or sub-type within a product type that is based on product features and installed components.
