Scale-up storage is a storage product comprised of a discreet storage controller (with or without redundancy), which has a full view of all the storage devices in the storage product. Incremental storage capacity is added by the addition of storage devices under the control of the existing storage controller.  While Scale-out storage is a storage product capable of being comprised of two or more discreet storage controllers (with or without redundancy), combined with an overall integration or aggregation function resulting in a single storage product view for attached servers. Each discreet storage controller often has a partial view to a partition of the overall system's storage devices, but this is not a fixed requirement. Incremental storage capacity is added by the addition of storage devices under the control of the existing storage controller(s) and/or addition of additional storage devices along with additional controller(s).", "The date on which the product was confirmed to meet the ENERGY STAR specification.", "The ready idle measurement for storage device 2 optimal point in GB per watt.
