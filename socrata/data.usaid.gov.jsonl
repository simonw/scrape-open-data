(2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large\u00ad-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL\u00ad-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-\u00adminute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5\u00ad-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-\u00adminute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl.

{"resource": {"name": "Data for Efficacy of Heavy Duty Tarp Disinfection (E. coli)", "id": "ygp8-z2fg", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, international organizations provided conflicting recommendations for disinfecting surfaces contaminated by uncontrolled patient spills. We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high \u00adtest hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre\u00adcleaning practices (pre\u00adwiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9\u00ad and 3.1\u00adlog removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy \u00adduty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre\u00ad-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.", "attribution": "Tufts University", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-02-04T22:00:37.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-12-12T19:47:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-04T22:00:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-12-12T19:51:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["Chlorine Type", "Recommendation", "Soil load", "Material", "Exp.

The project will enable women by equipping them with an understanding of sound business practices, market forces, and trade related opportunities. Facilitated by mobile technology, the program increases women\u2019s access to key sources of market information and guides them to use that information to identify and seize more business opportunities.\r\n\r\nPact is augmenting the business development training for an estimated 300 of the 6,000 participants in its WORTH program. At the start of the project, Pact conducted a rapid assessment of barriers to women\u2019s full engagement in business, adapted from the USAID Diagnostic of Women Entrepreneurs. The purpose of the assessment was to garner an in-depth understanding of the business environment as well as the capacity and needs of Vietnamese participants. Pact then developed an augmented business training curriculum based on the results of the startup assessment.\r\n\r\nIn order to introduce mobile technology for an e-learning application/platform of the business materials, the assessment integrated information about participants\u2019 current level of capacity, the type of technology and devices currently most used by the women and their frequency of use. Members of existing WORTH groups will be given the opportunity to self-select into the MVE activities.", "attribution": "Pact", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset",
