For example two citizens would both pull an HVAC permit and one would have the valuation of $63.00 and the other $73.00. Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated?
