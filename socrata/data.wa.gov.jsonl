Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. All current long-term Ecology monitoring stations with at least 5 years data are included.  Most stations are located near the mouths of major streams.  These stations integrate upstream water quality and capture large basin-scale trends. However, status and trends at these locations may not reflect status or trends in any particular sub-basin.

{"resource": {"name": "Imaged Documents and Reports", "id": "j78t-andi", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This data set an index to all PDC imaged reports and documents. Political disclosure reports are included for the last 10 years. Other document types are included based on the PDC record retention schedule or 10 years. The number of years is determined by looking at both the election year and date submitted and including documents that meet either criteria (favoring the inclusion of documents). Each record contains a link to view the actual imaged document or a link on how to request the document for F1 statements of financial affairs.\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes both original and amended reports and documents. Data consumers must look at the individual documents to determine if a particular document has been superseded by an amendment. For example, a candidate might file a C4 summary report and file an amendment to the report. There is no indicator on the original C4 that it has been amended. For most documents, amendments have the term \"AMENDED\" as part of the origin field but the original document will not contain any indicator that it has been superseded by an amendment.\r\n\r\nLobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports are included through 2015 and partial records for 2016. In mid 2016 the PDC discontinued imaging lobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports. Please refer to the \"Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses\" dataset or the PDC online filing system at https://accesshub.pdc.wa.gov for the complete 2016 and later lobbyist information. The statement above does not apply to Public Agency Lobbying (L5) reports.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.\r\n\r\nDescriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF RELEASE: This publication constitutes a list of individuals prepared by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission and may not be used for commercial purposes.

Sediment(s) also includes settled particulate matter exposed by human activity (e.g., dredging) to the biologically active aquatic zone or to the water column.\"\n\nSoil: The MTCA definition of soil appears in Ch. 173-340-200: \u201c\u2026a mixture of organic and inorganic solids, air, water and the biota that exists on the earth\u2019s surface above bedrock, including materials of anthropogenic sources such as slag, sludge, etc.\u201d Soil is generally defined based on the particle size composition, and mineral and organic content.\n\nSurface Water: The MTCA definition of surface water is found at Ch. 173-340-200: \u201c\u2026lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and water courses within the state of Washington or under the jurisdiction of the state of Washington.\u201d", "Any hazardous substance that does not occur naturally or occurs at greater than natural background levels. (See WAC 173-340-200)\n\nFor a list of contaminants and their groups, see the contaminant cross reference spreadsheet.\n\nHalogentated Organics:\n\nHalogenated refers to a chemical compound or mixture that contains halogen atoms, i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Bonding to carbon the halogens form a class of compounds called covalent halides, i.e. they are not electroylytic in nature. Some other terms for these compounds are halocarbons (halogenated hydrocarbons), chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, a class of molecules containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon).\n\nMetals:\n\nThese derive from a number of sources, including lead in petrol, industrial effluents, and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain. They are easily incorporated into biological molecules and exert their toxic effects by displacing essential metals of a lower binding power in biologically active molecules or by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes.\n\nNon-Halogenated Organics:\n\nA class of organic compounds that contain at least one halogen (fluorine [F], chlorine [Cl], bromine [Br], or iodine [I]) bonded to carbon. They are subdivided into alkyl, vinylic, aryl, and acyl halides. In alkyl halides all four bonds to the carbon that bears the halogen are single bonds; in vinylic halides the carbon that bears the halogen is doubly bonded to another carbon; in aryl halides the halogen-bearing carbon is part of an aromatic ring; and in acyl halides (also called acid halides) the halogen-bearing carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen.\n\nOther Contaminants:\n\nMiscellaneous contaminants that do not fall under the other contaminant categories.\n\nPesticides:\n\nA substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.\n\nReactive Wastes:\n\nChemical waste that are unstable and readily undergo violent changes or react with water to form potentially explosive mixtures or generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes. Chemicals that contain cyanide or sulfide that can generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes.", "Unique identifier for the cleanup site.

There may have been an initial investigation, Phase I or Phase II site assessment. A remedial investigation has not been started. No independent, VCP, or Ecology supervised work has occurred toward cleaning up the site.\n\nIn general, sites will NOT be put back into \"Awaiting Cleanup\" status once they have started. Sites with terminated VCP projects will not be put back into \"Awaiting Cleanup\" status.\n\nCleanup Complete-Active O&M/Monitoring: Use only for sites where all construction and physical cleanup work has been done and cleanup standards met, but some active operation, maintenance, and/or monitoring work is required on an ongoing basis to maintain cleanup standards. Examples include: groundwater pump & treat, hydraulic containment, active gas or vapor control systems. This is used for sites that are essentially stable but are not eligible for delisting. (See Policy 330B, #4.)\n\nIf the construction has been completed, and the site is eligible to be delisted, then de-list the site and use the \"No Further Action Required\" site status.\n\nA periodic review must be scheduled when in this category.\n\nCleanup Started: Site remedial investigation or cleanup work has begun. Includes completed interim actions. Includes Ecology or EPA supervised sites, VCP sites, and independent sites where an emergency action, remedial investigation, interim action, feasibility study, site characterization, or any other type of cleanup work has begun.\n\nConstruction Complete - Performance Monitoring: Cleanup construction and source control are complete.

This should not be used for units in confirmation monitoring, which is for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of an action once cleanup and performance standards are confirmed to be met. Refer to WAC 173-340-410 (b) and (c).\n\nIn most cases, a periodic review should be scheduled when this unit status is selected.\n\nNo Further Action Required: For sites that have received a No Further Action determination (NFA) at the Initial Investigation or Site Hazard Assessment, received an NFA letter (not ranked), or have been delisted (if ranked). If site is ranked, it must not be put into this status until the formal delisting is completed.\n\nDo not use this status for sites that have been transferred to other programs or other agencies. Only use this for sites that have actually received an NFA.\n\nSites in this status may still need a periodic review, passive O & M, monitoring or inspections, or periodic repairs.\n\nNOTE: The Site Status cannot be changed to NFA at the Site Details screen. It must be changed by using the \"NFA this Cleanup Site\" wizard, available under the ISIS \"Workflows\" link.\n\nTracked by EPA: For sites where EPA is the Responsible Unit and Superfund lead, cleanup occurs under CERCLA only, and the Unit Process Type is Federal supervised/conducted cleanup. The Site Manager should be listed as EPA unless there is an Ecology staff person assigned to the site to verify compliance with state ARARs.\n\nDo not use this status for sites that are under joint authority.

Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated?

To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.
