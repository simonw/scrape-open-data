Examples include: groundwater pump & treat, hydraulic containment, active gas or vapor control systems. This is used for sites that are essentially stable but are not eligible for delisting.

Bonding to carbon the halogens form a class of compounds called covalent halides, i.e. they are not electroylytic in nature. Some other terms for these compounds are halocarbons (halogenated hydrocarbons), chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, a class of molecules containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon).\n\nMetals:\n\nThese derive from a number of sources, including lead in petrol, industrial effluents, and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain. They are easily incorporated into biological molecules and exert their toxic effects by displacing essential metals of a lower binding power in biologically active molecules or by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes.\n\nNon-Halogenated Organics:\n\nA class of organic compounds that contain at least one halogen (fluorine [F], chlorine [Cl], bromine [Br], or iodine [I]) bonded to carbon. They are subdivided into alkyl, vinylic, aryl, and acyl halides. In alkyl halides all four bonds to the carbon that bears the halogen are single bonds; in vinylic halides the carbon that bears the halogen is doubly bonded to another carbon; in aryl halides the halogen-bearing carbon is part of an aromatic ring; and in acyl halides (also called acid halides) the halogen-bearing carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen.\n\nOther Contaminants:\n\nMiscellaneous contaminants that do not fall under the other contaminant categories.\n\nPesticides:\n\nA substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.\n\nReactive Wastes:\n\nChemical waste that are unstable and readily undergo violent changes or react with water to form potentially explosive mixtures or generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes.

Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated?
