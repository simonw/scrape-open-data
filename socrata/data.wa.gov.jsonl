In the past the city employee would assign the dollar amount of the permit, this caused some confusion by citizens. For example two citizens would both pull an HVAC permit and one would have the valuation of $63.00 and the other $73.00. Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated? So again we assign $50.00 to the report.\u00a0Per Jason Ewing, City of Clarkston Public Works Department."}, {"key": "Temporal_Period-of-Time", "value": "January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019"}, {"key": "Temporal_Posting-Frequency", "value": "Annually"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.wa.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.wa.gov/d/uxv9-c2g9", "link": "https://data.wa.gov/Economics/City-of-Clarkston-Building-Permits/uxv9-c2g9", "owner": {"id": "arda-prru", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Mary Neuman"}, "creator": {"id": "arda-prru", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Mary Neuman"}}

To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.
