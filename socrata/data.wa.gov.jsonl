(See WAC 173-340-200)\n\nFor a list of contaminants and their groups, see the contaminant cross reference spreadsheet.\n\nHalogentated Organics:\n\nHalogenated refers to a chemical compound or mixture that contains halogen atoms, i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Bonding to carbon the halogens form a class of compounds called covalent halides, i.e. they are not electroylytic in nature. Some other terms for these compounds are halocarbons (halogenated hydrocarbons), chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, a class of molecules containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon).\n\nMetals:\n\nThese derive from a number of sources, including lead in petrol, industrial effluents, and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain. They are easily incorporated into biological molecules and exert their toxic effects by displacing essential metals of a lower binding power in biologically active molecules or by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes.\n\nNon-Halogenated Organics:\n\nA class of organic compounds that contain at least one halogen (fluorine [F], chlorine [Cl], bromine [Br], or iodine [I]) bonded to carbon. They are subdivided into alkyl, vinylic, aryl, and acyl halides. In alkyl halides all four bonds to the carbon that bears the halogen are single bonds; in vinylic halides the carbon that bears the halogen is doubly bonded to another carbon; in aryl halides the halogen-bearing carbon is part of an aromatic ring; and in acyl halides (also called acid halides) the halogen-bearing carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen.\n\nOther Contaminants:\n\nMiscellaneous contaminants that do not fall under the other contaminant categories.\n\nPesticides:\n\nA substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.\n\nReactive Wastes:\n\nChemical waste that are unstable and readily undergo violent changes or react with water to form potentially explosive mixtures or generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes. Chemicals that contain cyanide or sulfide that can generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes.", "Media are primary environmental components that may be affected by or carriers for contaminants, and from which targets such as people, plants, and wildlife may come in contact with contaminants.\n\nAir: The MTCA does not provide a definition for \"air.\" A common definition is: the gaseous mixture above the soil or surface waters.\n\nBedrock: The MTCA does not provide a definition for \"bedrock.\" A common definition is: The upper portion of the Earth's core, underlying soil and surface water or, at times exposed to the atmosphere, and composed solely of mineral or mineralized materials in relatively homogeneous formations.\n\nGroundwater: The MTCA definition of ground water is found in Ch. 173-340-200: \u201c\u2026water in a saturated zone or stratum beneath the surface of land or below a surface water.\u201d Under or near surface waters, it is important to establish the boundary between surface water and ground water, primarily through physical/chemical characteristic differences.\n\nSediment: The Sediment Management Standards definition of sediments is found at Ch. 173-204-200: \u201c\u2026settled particulate matter located in the predominant biologically active aquatic zone, or exposed to the water column. Sediment(s) also includes settled particulate matter exposed by human activity (e.g., dredging) to the biologically active aquatic zone or to the water column.\"\n\nSoil: The MTCA definition of soil appears in Ch. 173-340-200: \u201c\u2026a mixture of organic and inorganic solids, air, water and the biota that exists on the earth\u2019s surface above bedrock, including materials of anthropogenic sources such as slag, sludge, etc.\u201d Soil is generally defined based on the particle size composition, and mineral and organic content.\n\nSurface Water: The MTCA definition of surface water is found at Ch. 173-340-200: \u201c\u2026lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and water courses within the state of Washington or under the jurisdiction of the state of Washington.\u201d", "Latitude (North American Datum 1983 HARN)", "Cleanup Site Name", "Unique identifier for the agency Facility/Site record.

Generally, we would not enter each and every contaminant that was tested; for example if an SVOC analysis was done we would not enter each SVOC with a status of \"below\". We would use this for contaminants that were believed likely to be present but were found to be below standards when tested.\n\nConfirmed Above Cleanup Levels: The contaminant is confirmed to be present above any cleanup level or likely cleanup level. For example - above MTCA method A, B, or C; above Sediment Quality Standards; or above a presumed site-specific cleanup level (such as human health criteria for a sediment contaminant).\n\nRemediated - Above: The contaminant was remediated, but remains on site above the cleanup standards, such as under a cap, building, or in a containment cell. If media are Remediated-Above, the site must have institutional controls.\n\nRemediated - Below: The contaminant was remediated, and no area of the site contains this contaminant above cleanup standards (for example - complete removal of contaminated soils).\n\nSuspected: The contaminant is suspected to be present based on some knowledge about the history of the site, knowledge of regional contaminants, or based on other contaminants known to be present.", "Longitude (North American Datum 1983 HARN)", "The current status of the cleanup for the Site.\n\nAwaiting Cleanup: The site has been discovered.

Sites with terminated VCP projects will not be put back into \"Awaiting Cleanup\" status.\n\nCleanup Complete-Active O&M/Monitoring: Use only for sites where all construction and physical cleanup work has been done and cleanup standards met, but some active operation, maintenance, and/or monitoring work is required on an ongoing basis to maintain cleanup standards. Examples include: groundwater pump & treat, hydraulic containment, active gas or vapor control systems. This is used for sites that are essentially stable but are not eligible for delisting.

This should not be used for units in confirmation monitoring, which is for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of an action once cleanup and performance standards are confirmed to be met. Refer to WAC 173-340-410 (b) and (c).\n\nIn most cases, a periodic review should be scheduled when this unit status is selected.\n\nNo Further Action Required: For sites that have received a No Further Action determination (NFA) at the Initial Investigation or Site Hazard Assessment, received an NFA letter (not ranked), or have been delisted (if ranked).

Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated?

To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.
