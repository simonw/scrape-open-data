For temperature, pH, oxygen, and fecal coliform bacteria, the WQI is based on criteria in Washington\u2019s Water Quality Standards, WAC 173-201A.

Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. All current long-term Ecology monitoring stations with at least 5 years data are included.  Most stations are located near the mouths of major streams.  These stations integrate upstream water quality and capture large basin-scale trends. However, status and trends at these locations may not reflect status or trends in any particular sub-basin.

The Governor and the Legislature look to the OCIO to provide guidance on whether an agency's proposed IT expenditure is sound and consistent with the state\u2019s IT strategy to inform policy decisions on the allocation of limited state funds.\n\nThe OCIO establishes prioritization criteria in response to current state business needs and changing technologies. The OCIO evaluates agency funding requests (received in the form of decision packages) against those values and establishes a priority ranking of all funding requests.

The telephone survey was conducted using random digit dialing.  To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.  Any manipulation or analysis of the data should take this sampling approach and weighting into account.", "attribution": "Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office (WA RCO)",

Political disclosure reports are included for the last 10 years. Other document types are included based on the PDC record retention schedule or 10 years. The number of years is determined by looking at both the election year and date submitted and including documents that meet either criteria (favoring the inclusion of documents). Each record contains a link to view the actual imaged document or a link on how to request the document for F1 statements of financial affairs.\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes both original and amended reports and documents. Data consumers must look at the individual documents to determine if a particular document has been superseded by an amendment. For example, a candidate might file a C4 summary report and file an amendment to the report. There is no indicator on the original C4 that it has been amended. For most documents, amendments have the term \"AMENDED\" as part of the origin field but the original document will not contain any indicator that it has been superseded by an amendment.\r\n\r\nLobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports are included through 2015 and partial records for 2016. In mid 2016 the PDC discontinued imaging lobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports.

Examples include: groundwater pump & treat, hydraulic containment, active gas or vapor control systems. This is used for sites that are essentially stable but are not eligible for delisting.

Bonding to carbon the halogens form a class of compounds called covalent halides, i.e. they are not electroylytic in nature. Some other terms for these compounds are halocarbons (halogenated hydrocarbons), chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, a class of molecules containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon).\n\nMetals:\n\nThese derive from a number of sources, including lead in petrol, industrial effluents, and leaching of metal ions from the soil into lakes and rivers by acid rain. They are easily incorporated into biological molecules and exert their toxic effects by displacing essential metals of a lower binding power in biologically active molecules or by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of enzymes.\n\nNon-Halogenated Organics:\n\nA class of organic compounds that contain at least one halogen (fluorine [F], chlorine [Cl], bromine [Br], or iodine [I]) bonded to carbon. They are subdivided into alkyl, vinylic, aryl, and acyl halides. In alkyl halides all four bonds to the carbon that bears the halogen are single bonds; in vinylic halides the carbon that bears the halogen is doubly bonded to another carbon; in aryl halides the halogen-bearing carbon is part of an aromatic ring; and in acyl halides (also called acid halides) the halogen-bearing carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen.\n\nOther Contaminants:\n\nMiscellaneous contaminants that do not fall under the other contaminant categories.\n\nPesticides:\n\nA substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.\n\nReactive Wastes:\n\nChemical waste that are unstable and readily undergo violent changes or react with water to form potentially explosive mixtures or generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes. Chemicals that contain cyanide or sulfide that can generate toxic gases, vapors, or fumes.", "Status of the contaminant found in impacted media.\n\nBelow Cleanup Levels: The contaminant was tested and found to be below cleanup levels. Generally, we would not enter each and every contaminant that was tested; for example if an SVOC analysis was done we would not enter each SVOC with a status of \"below\". We would use this for contaminants that were believed likely to be present but were found to be below standards when tested.\n\nConfirmed Above Cleanup Levels: The contaminant is confirmed to be present above any cleanup level or likely cleanup level. For example - above MTCA method A, B, or C; above Sediment Quality Standards; or above a presumed site-specific cleanup level (such as human health criteria for a sediment contaminant).\n\nRemediated - Above: The contaminant was remediated, but remains on site above the cleanup standards, such as under a cap, building, or in a containment cell. If media are Remediated-Above, the site must have institutional controls.\n\nRemediated - Below: The contaminant was remediated, and no area of the site contains this contaminant above cleanup standards (for example - complete removal of contaminated soils).\n\nSuspected: The contaminant is suspected to be present based on some knowledge about the history of the site, knowledge of regional contaminants, or based on other contaminants known to be present.", "Unique identifier for the agency Facility/Site record.

Therefore we changed in 2017 and assigned $50.00 for every permit application than does not require a project dollar amount to complete the permitting process. Additionally roofing and siding projects are always more that the value assigned by our system. We received numerous calls when a home owner is quoted say 5k for a siding or roofing job and our system assigns 2500 to the project. The question ranged from do I need another permit to, did my contractor over sell my project, or am I being cheated?

To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.
