These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4' target='_blank'>Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contains the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.\n\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value.

There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field \u2018seconds\u2019. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \r\n\r\n3.
