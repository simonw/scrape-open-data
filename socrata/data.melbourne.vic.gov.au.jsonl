Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.\n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4' target='_blank'>Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contains the sensor location.
