The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don\u2019t currently join.\n\n<b>Field information:</b>\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive.

Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times.
