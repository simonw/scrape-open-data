The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with related datasets. \n<p>Since the inauguration of the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx\">Pedestrian Counting System</a> in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\n<p>Sensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria \u2013 retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city\u2019s commitment to expanding the system. \n<p>Status field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed.

The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don\u2019t currently join.\n\n<b>Field information:</b>\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive.

TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times.
