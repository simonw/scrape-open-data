This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\n<p>Sensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria \u2013 retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city\u2019s commitment to expanding the system. \n<p>Status field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed.

Each restriction consists of a set of columns:\n\n<b>How the data joins:</b>\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don\u2019t currently join.\n\n<b>Field information:</b>\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)\n- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.\n- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.\n- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.\n\n<b>Disclaimer:</b>\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n\u00b7         there may be errors or omission in it\n\u00b7         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.", "attribution": "City of Melbourne", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-03-01T22:22:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-09-22T07:59:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-03-01T22:22:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-09-14T16:04:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["StartTime2", "Description3", "Duration1", "FromDay6", "FromDay3", "Duration4", "FromDay2", "ToDay5", "TypeDesc4", "ToDay3", "Exemption4", "Exemption6", "StartTime4", "EndTime5", "DisabilityExt3", "Exemption1", "Description5", "EndTime4", "EffectiveOnPH6", "DisabilityExt1", "Description2", "Duration5", "StartTime3", "Exemption5", "FromDay4", "ToDay4", "DisabilityExt5", "Exemption3", "ToDay6", "DisabilityExt4", "EndTime3", "DisabilityExt2", "Duration6", "TypeDesc1", "TypeDesc5", "DisabilityExt6", "EffectiveOnPH2", "Exemption2", "EndTime6", "TypeDesc6", "FromDay5", "BayID", "EffectiveOnPH4", "Description4", "EffectiveOnPH1", "ToDay1", "StartTime5", "FromDay1", "StartTime6", "EffectiveOnPH5", "DeviceID", "EndTime1", "Description1", "ToDay2", "EffectiveOnPH3", "Duration3", "Description6", "StartTime1", "TypeDesc2", "TypeDesc3", "Duration2", "EndTime2"], "columns_field_name": ["starttime2", "description3", "duration1", "fromday6", "fromday3", "duration4", "fromday2", "today5", "typedesc4", "today3", "exemption4", "exemption6", "starttime4", "endtime5", "disabilityext3", "exemption1", "description5", "endtime4", "effectiveonph6", "disabilityext1", "description2", "duration5", "starttime3", "exemption5", "fromday4", "today4", "disabilityext5", "exemption3", "today6", "disabilityext4", "endtime3", "disabilityext2", "duration6", "typedesc1", "typedesc5", "disabilityext6", "effectiveonph2", "exemption2", "endtime6", "typedesc6", "fromday5", "bayid", "effectiveonph4", "description4", "effectiveonph1", "today1", "starttime5", "fromday1", "starttime6", "effectiveonph5", "deviceid", "endtime1", "description1", "today2", "effectiveonph3", "duration3", "description6", "starttime1", "typedesc2", "typedesc3", "duration2", "endtime2"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The time each day when the restriction applies.", "Description: A compact, semi-human-readable description of the overall restrictions.

Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.\n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4' target='_blank'>Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contains the sensor location.
