Therefore aggregate totals of crimes are accurate, without providing sensitive information. Addresses are not included for: sexual abuse, sexual assault, suicide, incest, molestation of a child or homicide. \n\nSimilar information is also provided through the Communitycrimemap.com website, a 3rd party service that visually reviews crime data for Mesa and outlining areas. \n\nSome of the data fields provided are used to report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
