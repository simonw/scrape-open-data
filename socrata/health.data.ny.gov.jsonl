Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS. Further, certain tests such as RIDTs have limited accuracy; false negative and false positive results do occur.   The number of laboratories reporting data to ECLRS has increased over time. However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza\u2019s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/jr8b-6gh6", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Influenza-Laboratory-Confirmed-Cases-By-County-Beg/jr8b-6gh6", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}
