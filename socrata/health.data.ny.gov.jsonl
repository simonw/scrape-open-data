Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS. Further, certain tests such as RIDTs have limited accuracy; false negative and false positive results do occur.   The number of laboratories reporting data to ECLRS has increased over time. However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza\u2019s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/jr8b-6gh6", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Influenza-Laboratory-Confirmed-Cases-By-County-Beg/jr8b-6gh6", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}
