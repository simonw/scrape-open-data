Participating programs in CACFP are child care centers, including Head Start centers, outside school hours programs serving children through age twelve in licensed or registered non-residential settings, after school programs providing educational or enrichment programming for children up to nineteen years of age in low income areas, community-based adult day care centers that are approved by federal, state or local authorities to provide day care services to functionally impaired adults through individualized care plans and home-based family and group child care.  The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents. The EWPH-DCH (East Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes) project was designed as an educational and environmental change program with DCH (Day Care Home) providers as the primary target audience and the children and their parents as the secondary target audiences.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS. Further, certain tests such as RIDTs have limited accuracy; false negative and false positive results do occur.   The number of laboratories reporting data to ECLRS has increased over time. However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza\u2019s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/jr8b-6gh6", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Influenza-Laboratory-Confirmed-Cases-By-County-Beg/jr8b-6gh6", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}
