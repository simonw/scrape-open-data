Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017. Beginning in 2015, New York State modified the sampling methodology for the BRFSS survey to support calculation of rates at a regional level.

The DSRIP program will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically a goal to achieve a 25 percent reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years. As a part of the DSRIP program, Performing Provider System will employ multiple projects both to transform health care delivery as well as to address the broad needs of the population that the performing provider system serves. These projects described in Attachment J are grouped into different strategies, such as behavioral health, within each Domain (System Transformation Projects (Domain 2), Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3), and Population-wide Projects (Domain 4). For each strategy, there is a set of metrics that the performing provider system will be responsible for if they do any one of the projects within that strategy.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

This dataset is at the county level. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years).  The rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information. \r\n\r\nThe observed rates and expected rates for each AHRQ PQI is presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": "http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-11-16T17:30:46.000Z", "createdAt": "2014-04-14T14:00:48.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-11-16T17:30:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-11-16T17:30:46.000Z", "columns_name": ["Software Version", "PQI Name", "PQI Number", "Observed Rate Per 100,000 People", "Year", "Patient County", "Expected Rate Per 100,000 People"], "columns_field_name": ["software_version", "pqi_name", "pqi_number", "observed_rate_per_100_000_people", "year", "patient_county", "expected_rate_per_100_000_people"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["AHRQ software version used to produce quality indicators for this year.", "The descriptive name of the PQI measure.

Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests reported by the end of the day on the day before the update).\n<p>\n<b>Note</b>: On November 14, 2020, only 14 hours of laboratory data was collected and shared. A 2:00 pm cutoff time was implemented, allowing the NYSDOH to enhance data quality reviews. All other published laboratory data represented 24 hours of data collection.\n</p><p>\n\n<p>\n<b>As of 4/4/22, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) no longer requires entities conducting COVID testing to report negative or indeterminate antigen test results. This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of 4/5/22, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.</p><p>\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n</p><p>\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested.
