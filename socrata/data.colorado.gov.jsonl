Some of the first fish production facilities in the country were established in this state. Unlike other states located in the southern tier and coastal areas of the U.S., Colorado does not have a reputation as a major producer of aquacultured products. A semi-arid, continental-temperate climate, resulting in a relative scarcity of water, and a land-locked border discourage widespread use of \"traditional\" forms of aquaculture that require large amounts of flowing or standing water and year-round, sub-tropical temperatures. As a result of the relative limitations imposed on traditional aquaculture by the state\u2019s natural resources and climate, some individuals and companies have resorted to more innovative approaches and technologies for producing warmwater aquatic organisms. Additionally, they have begun to take advantage of man-made resources and some natural resources that are unique to Colorado (abundant sunshine and significant geothermal resources) by turning to indoor, high-density production in water recirculation tank systems as a means to conserve water, to economically heat water for the production of warmwater fishes, and to retain these valuable resources within the production system.  When these indoor fish production techniques are coupled with the production of plants (an integrated approach called aquaponics), production and conservation of resources are enhanced even more. Complementing the interest in the private sector in new aquaculture opportunities, Colorado state government restructured its jurisdiction over aquaculture activities. Fish production has now been formally recognized as an agricultural pursuit and is entitled to the same kinds of benefits and incentives as other agricultural activities.

Therefore, it is mandatory for Respondents to furnish requested energy information on all EIA survey forms that are applicable to them for each reporting period. Each year, the EIA sends a copy of their Forms (including form completion instructions) to all Respondents. The instructions fully explain who is required to file the given form, and definitions are provided to clarify the types of data being requested. The Natural Gas Information Annual Respondent Query System (henceforth referred to as the Query System) shows Annual Natural Gas Supply and Disposition and Underground Gas Storage data collected from several of these forms, down to the company level. Data are displayed in various formats from three different surveys. The EIA-176 form contains responses submitted from an identified universe of pipelines, local distribution companies, and operators of fields, wells or gas processing plants, who distribute gas to end users or transport gas across State borders; or underground natural gas storage operators. The EIA 191 collects information on working and base gas in reservoirs, injections, withdrawals, and location of reservoirs from operators of all underground natural gas storage fields on a monthly basis.

The data is updated as necessary to the main lobbyist online system via manual entry, however the updates to the Colorado Information Marketplace is only done weekly, every Monday night. Data goes back to 1995, but in 2002 a mandate established that the secretary of state transition to an online system. Then in 2010 Senate Bill 10-87, among other major changes, shifted the lobbyist registration and disclosure periods to the state fiscal year rather than the calendar year. Multiple bills are associated with a single monetary transaction (gross income) for a given month from a client to a lobbyist, and they are listed in the billInformationAndPosition field along with the position of the client. In a reporting month, income is reported based on the date that it is actually received. For example, in the event that a payment is made cumulatively over a three month period, they must report the full three month payment, and associated bills, when the payment was received. If a lobbyist has multiple payments received by various clients, each dollar amount is reported separately by each client. The statute specifies that lobbyists report the total amount they receive from the client. This is how the data is collected, and based on this database structure individual amounts associated with individual bills cannot be reported separately. State Liaisons are not required to report their position on the bill, only the legislation on which the lobbying is being performed."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Lobbyist and client name, contact, information/position on bill, income received, and date income was received"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": "02/15/2016"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Stewardship-Plan", "value": "Automatic"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Automated - weekly"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/gxnn-wthy", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Lobbyist/Bill-Information-and-Position-with-Income-of-Lobby/gxnn-wthy", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

Overall regional and statewide expenditure will be tracked against regional and statewide established planning budget totals. 3. As project details focus over time, planned project funding may be modified or redirected among Regional projects to optimize expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned withing each Region. 4. As project details focus over time, funding may be redirected, if approved, between the Regions to optimize statewide expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned statewide. 5. As needed to address typical project delivery constraints, Regions may move listed projects between planning years while maintaining planning total amounts over time. 6. Projects on the STP Planning lists that are constructed using non-SUR funds may be replaced on the list with new projects as long as the established STP and PMS criteria remain satisfied. 7.
