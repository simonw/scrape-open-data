The data is updated as necessary to the main lobbyist online system via manual entry, however the updates to the Colorado Information Marketplace is only done weekly, every Monday night. Data goes back to 1995, but in 2002 a mandate established that the secretary of state transition to an online system. Then in 2010 Senate Bill 10-87, among other major changes, shifted the lobbyist registration and disclosure periods to the state fiscal year rather than the calendar year. Multiple bills are associated with a single monetary transaction (gross income) for a given month from a client to a lobbyist, and they are listed in the billInformationAndPosition field along with the position of the client. In a reporting month, income is reported based on the date that it is actually received. For example, in the event that a payment is made cumulatively over a three month period, they must report the full three month payment, and associated bills, when the payment was received. If a lobbyist has multiple payments received by various clients, each dollar amount is reported separately by each client. The statute specifies that lobbyists report the total amount they receive from the client. This is how the data is collected, and based on this database structure individual amounts associated with individual bills cannot be reported separately.

In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction. The Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado\u2019s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.", "attribution": "Colorado Department of Education",

Overall regional and statewide expenditure will be tracked against regional and statewide established planning budget totals. 3. As project details focus over time, planned project funding may be modified or redirected among Regional projects to optimize expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned withing each Region. 4. As project details focus over time, funding may be redirected, if approved, between the Regions to optimize statewide expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned statewide. 5.

The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.", "attribution": "Colorado Department of Education",

The insolation values represent the resource available to fixed flat plate system tilted towards the equator at an angle equal to the latitude. The data are created using the SUNY Satellite Solar Radiation model (Perez, et.al., 2002). The data are averaged from hourly model output over 8 years (1998-2009). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The direct beam radiation is then calculated using the atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols, which are derived from a variety of sources. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNREL Solar Maps\n\nSolar Resource Assessment\n\nRelated Apps:\n\nSolar Prospector\n\nOpen PV Project\n\nPVDAQ\n\nIMBY\n\nSystem Advisor Model\n\nTheoretical Potential:\n\nRural utility-scale PV Generation Potential - 280,600 TWh\n\nRural utility-scale PV Capacity Potential - 153,000 GW\n\nUrban utility-scale PV Generation Potential - 2,200 TWh\n\nUrban utility-scale PV Capacity Potential - 1,200 GW\n\nRooftop PV Generation Potential - 800 TWh\n\nRooftop PV Capacity Potential - 664 GW\n\nRE Potential\n\nReport\n\nSource: Perez-SUNY/NREL, 2007\n\nThe data for Alaska was created using the Climatological Solar Radiation Model (Maxwell, George and Wilcox, 1998; George and Maxwell, 1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmospheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere, to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 8-year histogram (1985 - 1992) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources, as summarized in the references.

The insolation values represent the resource available to concentrating systems that track the sun throughout the day. The data are created using the SUNY Satellite Solar Radiation model (Perez, et.al., 2002). The data are averaged from hourly model output over 8 years (1998-2009). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The direct beam radiation is then calculated using the atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols, which are derived from a variety of sources. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNREL Solar Maps\n\nSolar Resource Assessment\n\nRelated Apps:\n\nSolar Prospector\n\nTechnical Potential:\n\nGeneration Potential - 116,100 TWh\n\nCapacity Potential - 38,000 GW\n\nRE Potential\n\nReport\n\nSource: Perez-SUNY/NREL, 2007\n\nLink: http://www.nrel.gov/gis", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-28T01:20:44.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:35:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["dni_oct", "dni_aug", "dni_jul", "dni_may", "dni_mar", "dni_feb", "dni_jan", "dni_nov", "dni_jun", "dni_apr", "the_geom", "ave_dni", "dni_dec", "dni_sep"], "columns_field_name": ["dni_oct", "dni_aug", "dni_jul", "dni_may", "dni_mar", "dni_feb", "dni_jan", "dni_nov", "dni_jun", "dni_apr", "the_geom", "ave_dni", "dni_dec", "dni_sep"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "MultiPolygon", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/x88m-3a2j", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/dataset/Concentrated-Solar-Power-in-Colorado/x88m-3a2j", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}
