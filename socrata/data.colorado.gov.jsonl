The computed potential hydropower energy and capacity are estimates based on non-directly measured flow and head and hence do not represent the actual numbers for engineering design. This resource assessment is not intended to provide economic feasibility level studies at each individual site. It will be the users\u2019 sole responsibility to determine whether if any site is worthy for further development.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNational Hydropower Asset Assessment Program\n\nU.S. DOE Water Power Program", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-30T20:23:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-30T19:54:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:23:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:23:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["mwh12", "mwh07", "mwh09", "mwh10", "mwh11", "mw", "water", "mwhyr", "mwh01", "mwh06", "mwh05", "mwh04", "mwh03", "mwh02", "dmname", "huc02", "mwh08", "Counties", "the_geom", "gid"], "columns_field_name": ["mwh12", "mwh07", "mwh09", "mwh10", "mwh11", "mw", "water", "mwhyr", "mwh01", "mwh06", "mwh05", "mwh04", "mwh03", "mwh02", "dmname", "huc02", "mwh08", ":@computed_region_nku6_53ud", "the_geom", "gid"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Counties' (nku6-53ud) the point in column 'the_geom' is located.
