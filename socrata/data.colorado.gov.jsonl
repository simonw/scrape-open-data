In December of 2009 Colorado adopted revised academic content standards progressing from early school readiness to postsecondary competencies reflective of both workforce readiness and 21st century skills. In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction.\r\nThe Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado\u2019s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed. The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.", "attribution": "Colorado Department of Education",

The insolation values represent the resource available to fixed flat plate system tilted towards the equator at an angle equal to the latitude. The data are created using the SUNY Satellite Solar Radiation model (Perez, et.al., 2002). The data are averaged from hourly model output over 8 years (1998-2009). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The direct beam radiation is then calculated using the atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols, which are derived from a variety of sources. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNREL Solar Maps\n\nSolar Resource Assessment\n\nRelated Apps:\n\nSolar Prospector\n\nOpen PV Project\n\nPVDAQ\n\nIMBY\n\nSystem Advisor Model\n\nTheoretical Potential:\n\nRural utility-scale PV Generation Potential - 280,600 TWh\n\nRural utility-scale PV Capacity Potential - 153,000 GW\n\nUrban utility-scale PV Generation Potential - 2,200 TWh\n\nUrban utility-scale PV Capacity Potential - 1,200 GW\n\nRooftop PV Generation Potential - 800 TWh\n\nRooftop PV Capacity Potential - 664 GW\n\nRE Potential\n\nReport\n\nSource: Perez-SUNY/NREL, 2007\n\nThe data for Alaska was created using the Climatological Solar Radiation Model (Maxwell, George and Wilcox, 1998; George and Maxwell, 1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmospheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere, to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 8-year histogram (1985 - 1992) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources, as summarized in the references.

The insolation values represent the resource available to concentrating systems that track the sun throughout the day. The data are created using the SUNY Satellite Solar Radiation model (Perez, et.al., 2002). The data are averaged from hourly model output over 8 years (1998-2009). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The direct beam radiation is then calculated using the atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols, which are derived from a variety of sources. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNREL Solar Maps\n\nSolar Resource Assessment\n\nRelated Apps:\n\nSolar Prospector\n\nTechnical Potential:\n\nGeneration Potential - 116,100 TWh\n\nCapacity Potential - 38,000 GW\n\nRE Potential\n\nReport\n\nSource: Perez-SUNY/NREL, 2007\n\nLink: http://www.nrel.gov/gis", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-28T01:20:44.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:35:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["ave_dni", "dni_dec", "dni_oct", "dni_sep", "dni_aug", "dni_jul", "dni_may", "dni_mar", "dni_feb", "dni_jan", "dni_nov", "dni_jun", "dni_apr", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["ave_dni", "dni_dec", "dni_oct", "dni_sep", "dni_aug", "dni_jul", "dni_may", "dni_mar", "dni_feb", "dni_jan", "dni_nov", "dni_jun", "dni_apr", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-30T20:35:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/x88m-3a2j", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/dataset/Concentrated-Solar-Power-in-Colorado/x88m-3a2j", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

The computed potential hydropower energy and capacity are estimates based on non-directly measured flow and head and hence do not represent the actual numbers for engineering design. This resource assessment is not intended to provide economic feasibility level studies at each individual site. It will be the users\u2019 sole responsibility to determine whether if any site is worthy for further development.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nNational Hydropower Asset Assessment Program\n\nU.S. DOE Water Power Program", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-30T20:23:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-30T19:54:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:23:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-30T20:23:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["mw", "mwh11", "mwh10", "mwh09", "mwh07", "mwh06", "mwh05", "mwh04", "mwh03", "mwh02", "mwh01", "mwhyr", "water", "gid", "the_geom", "Counties", "mwh12", "mwh08", "huc02", "dmname"], "columns_field_name": ["mw", "mwh11", "mwh10", "mwh09", "mwh07", "mwh06", "mwh05", "mwh04", "mwh03", "mwh02", "mwh01", "mwhyr", "water", "gid", "the_geom", ":@computed_region_nku6_53ud", "mwh12", "mwh08", "huc02", "dmname"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Counties' (nku6-53ud) the point in column 'the_geom' is located.
