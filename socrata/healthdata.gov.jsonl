{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries", "id": "g62h-syeh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization <b>in a timeseries format</b> dating back to January 1, 2020. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).\n\nThe file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.\n\nNo statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.\n\nThe below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to more than one reporting source: HHS TeleTracking, NHSN, and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, prioritization is applied to the numbers for each facility.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, this data set has had the following fields

These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\n<ul><li>A \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d. \n\n<b> A story page was created to display both corrected and raw datasets and can be accessed at this link: https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/nhgk-5gpv </b>\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\n<ul><li>hhs_ids\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum</li></ul>\n\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set has been converted to a corrected data set.  The corrections applied to this data set are to smooth out data anomalies caused by keyed in data errors.  To help determine which records have had corrections made to it.
