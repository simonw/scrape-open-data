This is due to the expansion and contraction of the pipe material which weakens it. Pipe corrosion, soil conditions, age and ground movement can also cause water main breaks, creating unexpected problems for customers and motorists. DC Water averages between 400 and 500 water main breaks per year.\r\n\r\nDuring the busiest weeks, DC Water may have over 20 different water main breaks at one time. DC Water prioritizes water main repairs based on several factors such as severity of the break, impact to customers and the environment, potential damage to public and private property, and unsafe traffic conditions due to street flooding. Anyone observing water running from streets or sidewalks is encouraged to report the leak to DC Water.
