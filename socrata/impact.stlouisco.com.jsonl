Through its American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau produces 5-year estimates for most geographies in the U.S, and its territories. The educational attainment estimates reports a percentage of the population who have completed increasing levels of education from less than high school completion to a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Estimates are for the highest level of education completed.\n\nThis dataset is for the Census bureau defined ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA).
