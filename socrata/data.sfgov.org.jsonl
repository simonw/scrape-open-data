SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-06T16:02:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T17:31:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-06T16:02:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T16:02:34.000Z", "columns_name": ["tests", "data_loaded_at", "pct", "pos", "neg", "Last Updated At", "indeterminate", "specimen_collection_date"], "columns_field_name": ["tests", "data_loaded_at", "pct", "pos", "neg", "last_updated_at", "indeterminate", "specimen_collection_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Number of persons tested", "", "Percent positive", "Number of positive results", "Number of negative results", "", "Number of indeterminate results", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precision": "3"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-15T01:14:24.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/nfpa-mg4g", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/Covid-19-Tests/nfpa-mg4g", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Habitat_int", "Thrifty150_int", "Top20", "Water_Needs", "Top20_int", "Super60", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Thrifty150", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Super60_int", "Former_Latin_Name", "Habitat", "Soil_Type", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Plant_Communities", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Size_at_Maturity", "Flower_Color", "Bloom_Time", "Plant_Type", "Family_Name", "Common_Name", "Latin_Name", "Special_List", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "PhotoCredit04", "PhotoCredit03", "PhotoCredit02", "PhotoCredit01", "Sandy_Soil", "Shady_Clay_int", "Shady_Clay", "Nurseries", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "Street_Tree_List", "Appropriate_Location", "Stormwater_int", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Associated_Wildlife", "Habitat_Value", "Pruning_Needs"], "columns_field_name": ["sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "habitat_int", "thrifty150_int", "top20", "water_needs", "top20_int", "super60", "sandy_soil_int", "thrifty150", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "super60_int", "former_latin_name", "habitat", "soil_type", "suitable_site_conditions", "plant_communities", "climate_appropriate_plants", "size_at_maturity", "flower_color", "bloom_time", "plant_type", "family_name", "common_name", "latin_name", "special_list", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "photocredit04", "photocredit03", "photocredit02", "photocredit01", "sandy_soil", "shady_clay_int", "shady_clay", "nurseries", "additional_characteristices_notes", "street_tree_list", "appropriate_location", "stormwater_int", "stormwater_benefit", "associated_wildlife", "habitat_value", "pruning_needs"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nIn 2017, an inventory was compiled manually by staff and it has been updated with each new mural created since.\n\n<strong>C.

HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThe majority of murals have street addresses but a few have street intersections instead. The address is the building location but the mural may be on the side of the building or around the corner. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the \"Cultural_District\" column and separated by a semicolon.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-06T21:49:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-06T02:15:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-06T21:49:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T16:42:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["TOTAL_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "AGE_GROUP", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "OVERALL_SEGMENT", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "DATA_AS_OF", "MAX_DATE_ADMINISTERED", "TOTAL_SERIES_COMPLETED", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "TOTAL_RECIPIENTS", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION", "TOTAL_1ST_DOSES", "TOTAL_SINGLE_DOSES", "TOTAL_2ND_DOSES", "TOTAL_BOOSTER_DOSES", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER"], "columns_field_name": ["total_booster_recipients", "demographic_subgroup", "age_group", "administering_provider_type", "overall_segment", "data_updated_at", "age_group_population", "demographic_group", "data_as_of", "max_date_administered", "total_series_completed", "data_loaded_at", "total_recipients", "subgroup_population", "total_1st_doses", "total_single_doses", "total_2nd_doses", "total_booster_doses", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Total number of unique booster recipients", "Specific demographic group counted in a given record (e.g. 16-24, Asian)", "Age range included in a given OVERALL_SEGMENT", "Providers included in a given OVERALL_SEGMENT.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to San Francisco residents over time. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-06T21:55:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-11T21:56:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-06T21:55:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T16:43:28.000Z", "columns_name": ["NEW_RECIPIENTS", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "NEW_1ST_DOSES", "NEW_SINGLE_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "CUMULATIVE_1ST_DOSES", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED", "NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "CUMULATIVE_SERIES_COMPLETED", "CUMULATIVE_SINGLE_DOSES", "DATE_ADMINISTERED", "CUMULATIVE_2ND_DOSES", "NEW_2ND_DOSES", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES", "DATA_AS_OF", "AGE_GROUP", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "OVERALL_SEGMENT"], "columns_field_name": ["new_recipients", "age_group_population", "new_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "new_1st_doses", "new_single_doses", "cumulative_recipients", "data_loaded_at", "cumulative_1st_doses", "subgroup_population", "demographic_subgroup", "new_series_completed", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_single_doses", "date_administered", "cumulative_2nd_doses", "new_2nd_doses", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order", "demographic_group", "administering_provider_type", "cumulative_booster_doses", "data_as_of", "age_group", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "overall_segment"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Count of individuals vaccinated (with any dose) for the first time according to CA's records", "American Community Survey population estimates for overall AGE_GROUP", "Count of booster doses administered on a given day", "Timestamp when the data was last compiled by scripts", "Count of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Count of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Cumulative total individuals vaccinated (with any dose) according to CA's records", "Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Cumulative total of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "American Community Survey population estimates for given DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "Specific demographic group counted in a given record (e.g. 16-24, Asian)", "Count of individuals that have newly completed their primary vaccine series on a given day", "Count of individuals who received a booster dose on a given day", "Cumulative total individuals that have completed their primary vaccine series", "Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Date vaccination administered", "Cumulative total of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Count of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Numeric sort order for all DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUPs.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.
