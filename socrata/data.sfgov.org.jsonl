SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments.

Speed limits are indicated primarily for streets that have speeds greater than 25 MPH, unless the speed limit has been changed from a higher speed or a speed survey has been conducted to enforce the de facto speed limit of 25 MPH. 25 MPH is the de fact speed limit for most residential and commercial streets, and apply to streets on this map denoted by a 0 MPH label. Alleys narrower than 25 feet can have de facto speed limits of 15 MPH. \n\nB. METHODOLOGY  Speed limit legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation and in some cases directives from engineers in the 5212 classification. Speed limit implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for speed limits will specify when signs are put in stating the new speed limits, and the work order that the sign installation was spec'd in.  \n\nC.

In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Prior to 1985, developers provided POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. The 1985 Downtown Plan created the first systemic requirements for developers to provide publicly accessible open space as a part of projects in C-3 Districts. The goal was to \u201cprovide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.\u201d (See Planning Code Section 138 for regulations). Since then, project sponsors for residential projects may provide POPOS instead of their required open spaces in the Downtown Residential (DTR) and Eastern Neighborhoods (Section 135 of the Planning Code).

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis data set reports key performance metrics for departments and programs in the City and County of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCity departments report updates about their key metrics to the Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller's Office uses an online application to collect and organize this data. Departments update most metrics once or twice each year. Some metrics may not display data for every year.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nMost metrics update twice each year. Updates with results for the first 6 months of each fiscal year are published in the spring, typically between April and May. Updates with results for each full fiscal year are published in the fall, typically in November.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row represents one metric and one fiscal year for a department, with multiple values for each fiscal year. Some metrics do not include values for all fields or fiscal years. Some results for the latest fiscal year are unavailable because of known lags in reporting. Users should review any data notes reported for each row for guidance about interpreting values. All values are reported as numbers without formatting, but the column [Measure Data Type] describes the intended format. For example, a value appearing as \u201c0.50\u201d with [Measure Data Type] reported as \u201cPercent\u201d should be displayed as \u201c50%\u201d.", "attribution": "City Performance Unit, CON", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-05-20T19:52:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-11-04T16:45:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-05-20T19:52:09.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-12-15T19:42:11.000Z", "columns_name": ["Strategic Goal", "Target", "Mid-Year Result", "Mid-Year Projection", "Measure Title", "Measure Methodology", "Measure Data Type", "Full-Year Result", "Fiscal Year", "Department Name", "Data Notes", "End Calendar Year", "Measure Description"], "columns_field_name": ["strategic_goal", "target", "mid_year_result", "mid_year_projection", "measure_title", "measure_methodology", "measure_data_type", "full_year_result", "fiscal_year", "department_name", "data_notes", "end_calendar_year", "measure_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Parent: The strategic goal with which the measure is associated.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row on this table represents the contents of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

{"resource": {"name": "San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database - Historical Ballot Propositions 1907-present", "id": "88s2-6ua9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\n\nThe San Francisco Public Library is thrilled to share our dataset from the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database on DataSF. This dataset contains full text of San Francisco ballot propositions dating back to 1907 and links to digitized PDF versions of the pamphlets for each election. \n\nVisit SFPL's <a href=\"https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/government-information-center/san-francisco-government/san-francisco-1/san-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database</a> for a keyword searchable interface and links to Voter Information pamphlets.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nSan Francisco Public Library received a Library Services and Technology grant to finance the digital scanning and microfilming of the Library's print collection of voter information pamphlets and handbooks for San Francisco municipal elections. Although not complete, the collection dates back to 1907. Approximately 59,000 voter pamphlet pages, including 1,500 propositions, were digitized into PDF files. For some elections, separate pamphlets were created for each voting district or a combination of each voting district and political party, and there is no singular representative pamphlet which includes all of the candidates for that election. As a result, the hard copies of the various pamphlets were bound together to represent that particular election, and this resulted in extra-large digitized versions. \n\nBecause the PDF files of the voter pamphlets are images instead of text, they cannot be searched electronically. San Francisco Public Library staff developed the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database to provide keyword access to San Francisco propositions, pass/fail outcomes and other information, and links to the full-text PDF Voter Information Pamphlet.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nThis dataset is updated when the final election results from the <a href=\"https://sfelections.sfgov.org/results\">San Francisco Department of Elections</a> are available.\n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "Campaign Finance - Summary Totals", "id": "9ggq-m8hp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains current summary information for electronically filed FPPC campaign forms. The columns in this dataset correspond to the figures reported on the summary page of FPPC forms 450, 460, 461, and 465. Refer to the <a href=\"https://fppc.ca.gov/forms.html\">FPPC Forms represented in this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTransactions from rejected and superseded filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\n\nA row with no value in the SyncFlag column indicates a paper filing amended an electronic filing. The SFEC is working on how to automatically deal with these cases.\n\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T08:10:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-03-01T23:23:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-04-05T23:25:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T08:10:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["Line 21 Col B", "Filing Type", "Line 22A Col A", "Line 5 Col A", "Sync Flag", "Schedule D Line 1", "Line 20 Col B", "Schedule D Line 2", "Schedule I Line 3", "Filer Type", "Form Type", "Line 1 Col B", "Line 11 Col B", "Schedule A Line 2", "Schedule F Line 3", "Line 3 Col B", "Line 2 Col B", "Filing Start Date", "Line 4 Col A", "Line 5 Col B", "Filer Name", "Line 9 Col A", "Line 17 Col A", "Schedule B1 Line 2", "Data As Of", "Line 7 Col B", "Schedule C Line 3", "Latest Filing Activity Nid", "Line 22C Col A", "Schedule F Line 2", "Data Loaded At", "Line 10 Col A", "Line 16 Col A", "Line 21 Col A", "Filer Nid", "Line 10 Col B", "Line 11 Col A", "Line 8 Col B", "Schedule C Line 2", "Schedule E Line 3", "Line 1 Col A", "Line 9 Col B", "Schedule A Line 1", "Schedule D Line 3", "Schedule H Line 1", "Line 14 Col A", "Schedule A Line 3", "Schedule H Line 3", "Filing Id Number", "Filing Nid", "Line 6 Col A", "Line 7 Col A", "Line 18 Col A", "Schedule F Line 1", "Schedule I Line 4", "Filing Date", "Filing End Date", "FPPC Id", "Line 2 Col A", "Line 3 Col A", "Line 4 Col B", "Line 6 Col B", "Line 8 Col A", "Line 12 Col A", "Line 13 Col A", "Line 15 Col A", "Line 19 Col A", "Line 20 Col A", "Line 22B Col A", "Schedule B1 Line 1", "Schedule B1 Line 3", "Schedule C Line 1", "Schedule E Line 1", "Schedule E Line 2", "Schedule E Line 4", "Schedule H Line 2", "Schedule I Line 1", "Schedule I Line 2"], "columns_field_name": ["line_21_col_b", "filing_type", "line_22a_col_a", "line_5_col_a", "sync_flag", "scheduled_line_1", "line_20_col_b", "scheduled_line_2", "schedulei_line_3", "filer_type", "form_type", "line_1_col_b", "line_11_col_b", "schedulea_line_2", "schedulef_line_3", "line_3_col_b", "line_2_col_b", "start_date", "line_4_col_a", "line_5_col_b", "filer_name", "line_9_col_a", "line_17_col_a", "scheduleb1_line_2", "data_as_of", "line_7_col_b", "schedulec_line_3", "filing_activity_nid", "line_22c_col_a", "schedulef_line_2", "data_loaded_at", "line_10_col_a", "line_16_col_a", "line_21_col_a", "filer_nid", "line_10_col_b", "line_11_col_a", "line_8_col_b", "schedulec_line_2", "schedulee_line_3", "line_1_col_a", "line_9_col_b", "schedulea_line_1", "scheduled_line_3", "scheduleh_line_1", "line_14_col_a", "schedulea_line_3", "scheduleh_line_3", "filing_id_number", "filing_nid", "line_6_col_a", "line_7_col_a", "line_18_col_a", "schedulef_line_1", "schedulei_line_4", "filing_date", "end_date", "fppc_id", "line_2_col_a", "line_3_col_a", "line_4_col_b", "line_6_col_b", "line_8_col_a", "line_12_col_a", "line_13_col_a", "line_15_col_a", "line_19_col_a", "line_20_col_a", "line_22b_col_a", "scheduleb1_line_1", "scheduleb1_line_3", "schedulec_line_1", "schedulee_line_1", "schedulee_line_2", "schedulee_line_4", "scheduleh_line_2", "schedulei_line_1", "schedulei_line_2"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Form 460 Only - For candidates running in both primary and general elections, Expenditures Made 7/1 to date", "One of [Original, Amendment, Correction]", "Form 460 Only - Expenditure limit summary for state candidates", "Form 460 - Total Contributions Received This Period;

The dataset was developed by DataSF as a convenience for matching parcels to districts where appropriate. This can be simpler than running a geospatial process every time you want to join parcels to a boundary.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to San Franciscans by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SF DPH) over time. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDifferent vaccines have different dosage requirements.  For example, the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines require two doses in order for a resident to complete their primary vaccine series (as of December 21, 2021).  Each dose is recorded separately in its respective dataset column.  Other vaccines, such as Johnson & Johnson, only require a single dose for a resident to complete their primary vaccine series (as of December 21, 2021).  Single dose vaccines counts are recorded in a separate dataset column.\n\nSumming the NEW_1ST_DOSES, NEW_2ND_DOSES, NEW_SINGLE_DOSES columns gives you the total count of primary vaccine series doses administered on a given day.  To count the number of individuals that have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED column. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the NEW_RECIPIENTS column. \n\nTo count the number of individuals who got a vaccine booster on a given day, use the NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS column. To count the number of booster doses administered on a given day, use the NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES column. To count the total number of individuals who have received a booster over time, use the CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS column. To count the total number of booster doses that have been administered over time, use the CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES column.\n\nIn <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a> we combine this dataset with <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the US Census's 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T15:17:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-12T06:10:57.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_1ST_DOSES", "DATE_ADMINISTERED", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES", "NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "NEW_RECIPIENTS", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "NEW_2ND_DOSES", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "CUMULATIVE_SERIES_COMPLETED", "CUMULATIVE_SINGLE_DOSES", "NEW_SINGLE_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_2ND_DOSES", "DATA_AS_OF", "NEW_1ST_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_RECIPIENTS", "NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED"], "columns_field_name": ["new_booster_doses", "cumulative_1st_doses", "date_administered", "cumulative_booster_doses", "new_booster_recipients", "new_recipients", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "data_loaded_at", "new_2nd_doses", "data_updated_at", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_single_doses", "new_single_doses", "cumulative_2nd_doses", "data_as_of", "new_1st_doses", "cumulative_recipients", "new_series_completed"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Count of booster doses administered on a given day", "Cumulative total of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Date Vaccination was administered", "Cumulative total booster doses administered to San Francisco residents", "Count of individuals who received a booster dose on a given day", "Count of individuals vaccinated (with any dose) for the first time according to CA's records", "Cumulative total individuals who have received a booster dose", "Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Count of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Timestamp when the data was last compiled by scripts", "Cumulative total individuals fully vaccinated (given the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single dose vaccine)", "Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Count of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Cumulative total of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Timestamp when the data was last updated in the source system", "Count of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Cumulative total individuals vaccinated (with any dose) according to CA's records", "Count of individuals that have newly completed their primary vaccine series on a given day "], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-02-11T00:25:55.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/9tca-udid", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-Vaccinations-Given-to-SF-Residents-by-SF-DPH/9tca-udid", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to San Franciscans over time.  All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR), run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDifferent vaccines have different dosage requirements.  For example, the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines require two doses in order for a resident to complete their primary vaccine series (as of December 21, 2021).  Each dose is recorded separately in its respective dataset column.  Other vaccines, such as Johnson & Johnson, would only require a single dose for a resident to complete their primary vaccine series (as of December 21, 2021). The Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 requires three separate doses. Single dose vaccines counts are recorded in a separate column.\n\nSumming the NEW_1ST_DOSES, NEW_2ND_DOSES, NEW_SINGLE_DOSES columns would give you the total count of primary vaccine series doses administered on a given day.  To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED column. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the NEW_RECIPIENTS column.\n\nTo count the number of individuals who got a vaccine booster on a given day, use the NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS column. To count the number of booster doses administered on a given day, use the NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES column. To count the total number of individuals who have received a booster over time, use the CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS column. To count the total number of booster doses that have been administered over time, use the CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES column.  \n\nIn <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a> we combine this dataset with <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the US Census's 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T15:17:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-12T06:10:30.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["DATE_ADMINISTERED", "CUMULATIVE_2ND_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_1ST_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "NEW_2ND_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES", "NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "NEW_SINGLE_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_SERIES_COMPLETED", "DATA_AS_OF", "NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_RECIPIENTS", "CUMULATIVE_SINGLE_DOSES", "NEW_RECIPIENTS", "NEW_1ST_DOSES"], "columns_field_name": ["date_administered", "cumulative_2nd_doses", "cumulative_1st_doses", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "new_2nd_doses", "cumulative_booster_doses", "new_series_completed", "data_loaded_at", "new_booster_recipients", "data_updated_at", "new_single_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "data_as_of", "new_booster_doses", "cumulative_recipients", "cumulative_single_doses", "new_recipients", "new_1st_doses"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date vaccination was administered", "Cumulative total of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Cumulative total of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Cumulative total individuals who have received a booster dose", "Count of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Cumulative total booster doses administered to San Francisco residents", "Count of individuals that have newly completed their primary vaccine series on a given day ", "Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Count of individuals who received a booster dose on a given day", "Timestamp when the data was last compiled by scripts", "Count of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Cumulative total individuals fully vaccinated", "Timestamp when the data was last updated in the source system", "Count of booster doses administered on a given day", "Cumulative total individuals vaccinated (with any dose) according to CA's records", "Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Count of individuals vaccinated (with any dose) for the first time according to CA's records", "Count of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-02-11T00:07:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": ["vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/bqge-2y7k", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-Vaccinations-Given-to-SF-Residents-Over-Time/bqge-2y7k", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

The Department of the Environment collects this data from various sources and calculates the emissions per current greenhouse gas protocols. This data supports San Francisco's climate change planning and mitigation strategies.\n\nNote: Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated based on the ICLEI 2012 U.S. Community Protocol Version 1.0. San Francisco inventories are completed in accordance with the ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol (USCP) for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The methodology and sectors tracked were third party verified in inventory year 2012. The subsequent inventories are completed according to the guidance of the verifiers.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on every arrest that has been presented to the SFDA since 2011 and the \u201caction\u201d decision made by the office on each, based on data from the SFDA\u2019s internal case management system.\n\nAfter law enforcement has made an arrest for suspected criminal activity, the arresting agency presents its evidence to the District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine what, if any, charges can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This prosecutorial decision to file or to reject arrest charges represents the first, and one of the most important, decisions of the District Attorney\u2019s Office. In addition to either filing new charges or declining to file charges (\u201cdischarging\u201d the arrest), the prosecutor may also take other actions, such as initiating a motion to revoke probation or parole, referring the case back to the arresting agency for further investigation, or referring the case to another criminal justice agency.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cDistrict Attorney Actions on Arrests Presented\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#sfda-actions-on-arrests-presented\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen an arrest is presented to the District Attorney\u2019s office, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases by Geography and Date", "id": "d2ef-idww", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: On January 22, 2022, system updates to improve the timeliness and accuracy of San Francisco COVID-19 cases and deaths data were implemented. You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.  Due to the changes, starting on January 22, 2022, the number of new cases reported daily will be higher than under the old system as cases that would have taken longer to process will be reported earlier.\n\n\n<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains COVID-19 positive confirmed cases aggregated by several different geographic areas and by day. COVID-19 cases are mapped to the residence of the individual and shown on the date the positive test was collected. In addition, 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year population estimates are included to calculate the cumulative rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nDataset covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Data updated daily.\n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from the COVID-19 case data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area for a given date.\n\nThe 2019 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a cumulative rate which is equal to ([cumulative count up to that date] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of total cases per 10,000 residents (as of the specified date).\n\nCOVID-19 case data undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes and are continually updated to maximize completeness and accuracy of information. This means data may change for previous days as information is updated.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 05:00 Pacific Time.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 throughout the city, in a variety of geographic areas. Note that the new cases column in the data represents the number of new cases confirmed in a certain area on the specified day, while the cumulative cases column is the cumulative total of cases in a certain area as of the specified date.\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Any area with a cumulative case count less than 10 are dropped for all days the cumulative count was less than 10. These will be null values.\n2. Once an area has a cumulative case count of 10 or greater, that area will have a new row of case data every day following.\n3. Cases are dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n4. Deaths data are not included in this dataset for privacy reasons. The low COVID-19 death rate in San Francisco, along with other publicly available information on deaths, means that deaths data by geography and day is too granular and potentially risky. Read more in our <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Data-Tracker-Publishing-Privacy-Guideline/9aj4-um47\">privacy guidelines</a>\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the cumulative case count is greater than or equal to 20.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on all cases presented to the District Attorney\u2019s Office in which the office has taken action to prosecute a case, either by filing new criminal charges or by filing a motion to revoke probation or parole (MTR). This does not include cases in which the San Francisco Adult Probation Department or the state Division of Adult Parole Operations files a motion to revoke.\n\nFor cases in which SFDA files a new criminal charge, the most serious offense type is categorized as the most serious offense for which SFDA prosecuted the defendant. For cases in which SFDA files an MTR, the most serious offense is categorized as the most serious offense for which the person was initially prosecuted. This is because a filing of an MTR means that new criminal charges were not filed for the new arresting offense, but rather that the District Attorney\u2019s Office is seeking a new sanction as part of the sentence of a prior criminal conviction. For MTRs, the filing date is based on the date when SFDA filed the MTR for the new arrest.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCases Prosecuted\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#cases-prosecuted\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen District Attorney\u2019s Office takes action to prosecute a case, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCases Prosecuted\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#cases-prosecuted\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries approved by the <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force#:~:text=The%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20consists,following%20each%20federal%20decennial%20census.\">San Francisco Redistricting Task Force</a></u> in April 2022 following redistricting based on the 2020 Decennial Census. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset was created from the <u><a href=\"https://sfgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=57159538a9a3422a9d22ef75d66565b6\">final map</a></u> submitted by the San Francisco Redistricting Task Force. These map boundaries were trimmed to align with the city and county's physical boundaries for greater usability. This trimming mainly consisted of excluding the water around the City and County from the boundaries.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor Districts reflected in this dataset will remain unchanged until after the next Decennial Census in 2030. A new dataset will be created after the next Decennial Census and redistricting process are completed. \n\nThe dataset is manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level. \n\n<strong>E.

SUMMARY Feature class includes geographic boundaries of neighborhoods in San Francisco identified as Muni Service Equity Strategy Neighborhoods.  These are defined for the Muni Service Equity Policy adopted by the SFMTA Board of Directors in May 2014.  For more information on this strategy refer to the latest FY Year 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 report: https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/agendaitems/2016/4-5-16%20Item%2013%20Muni%20Equity%20Strategy%20Report_1.pdf\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  Boundaries were created through geospatial analysis of demographic data using census tracts and defined boundaries of city planning neighborhoods. The following criteria was used in selecting neighborhood concentrations of households with low income, concentrations of residents who identify with a race other than white, zero vehicle ownership households, and concentrations of affordable and public housing developments.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Geospatial analysis conducted in concurrence with bi-annual Muni Service Equity Strategy report  \n\nD.

You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 related deaths by day. Deaths are included on the date the individual died.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 deaths are suspected to be associated with COVID-19. This means COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death or significant condition on the death certificate.  \n\nDeaths may be reported by: \n\n* Healthcare providers \n* The California Department of Public Health Vital Records \n* Case investigation or outbreak investigation  \n* The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner \n\nIt takes time to process this data. Because of this, data is lagged by 5 days and death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 AM Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 AM and 09:00 AM in case of pipeline failure.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new deaths and cumulative deaths by date of death. New deaths are the count of deaths on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths up to the date listed.\n\n\nUse the <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/kkr3-wq7h\">Deaths by Population Characteristics dataset</a> to see deaths by different subgroups including race/ethnicity, age, gender, and homelessness.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T14:03:19.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T18:02:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:03:16.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:03:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date of Death", "New Deaths", "Cumulative Deaths", "Data As Of", "Data Loaded At"], "columns_field_name": ["date_of_death", "new_deaths", "cumulative_deaths", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Date of death", "Count of new deaths", "Cumulative count of deaths", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Timestamp when data entered the socrata system"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-08T18:08:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "public safety", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/g2di-xufg", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Deaths-Over-Time/g2di-xufg", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

SUMMARY This dataset was first created as part of the SFMTA On Street Car Share Pilot Program (approved by the MTA Board in July 2013) to illustrate the location of implemented and planned (various stages) spaces throughout the city.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  The locations were originally provided to the MTA as requests by the three car share organizations (CSOs). These were given as a .kml file, which was converted to a .shp. Additional fields were created using spatial joins (zipcode, supervisor district, CNN, etc). Use definition query tool to display those locations with a certain attribute. For example, query Existing = 1 to display those locations that are on street operating. 500 submissions were given by CSOs to the MTA, but only a portion of those were brought to the MTA Board for approval, and even fewer were implemented as operational on street spaces. With no definition query, you can see all spaces as features, with varying levels of data completion. \n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  During periods of implementation/construction, updates were as frequent as daily or weekly. However, as the frequency of newly implemented spaces slowed over the course of the pilot, updates occurred less frequently--weekly or monthly. Updates will be needed as new spaces are implemented--many of the spaces not taken past MTA Board approval have incomplete data.  \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Each feature (or each row, or point) represents a single car share parking space. Some parking spaces belong to a \"pod\" where there are two adjacent car share parking spaces, indicated by the \"PodType\" field. To summarize or analyze by pod, use the \"POD\" field.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-05-11T16:35:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-04-24T21:36:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-05-11T16:35:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-05-11T16:34:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["SUPNAME", "shape", "CSO_NUM", "STATUS", "SUPDSTRICT", "PRICEZONE", "PODTYPE", "CNN_INTXN", "CNN_SEG", "INTRSXN", "ADDRESS", "OPER_DATE", "WO_COMPLET", "WO_STATUS", "WO_LOG_NO", "APPROVAL", "MTAB_DATE", "PH_DATE", "POST_ID", "ADDRANGE", "STREETNAME", "POINT_Y", "POINT_X", "CONFLICT", "SPACEID", "OBJECTID", "EXISTING", "WO_ROUND", "ZIPCODE", "GLOBALID", "NHOOD", "TASC_DATE", "ST_TYPE", "ST_NAME", "FLAG_NOTE", "DATEMODIFY", "DATESUBMIT", "CSO", "SPACE_TYPE", "POD", "INFO"], "columns_field_name": ["supname", "shape", "cso_num", "status", "supdstrict", "pricezone", "podtype", "cnn_intxn", "cnn_seg", "intrsxn", "address", "oper_date", "wo_complet", "wo_status", "wo_log_no", "approval", "mtab_date", "ph_date", "post_id", "addrange", "streetname", "point_y", "point_x", "conflict", "spaceid", "objectid", "existing", "wo_round", "zipcode", "globalid", "nhood", "tasc_date", "st_type", "st_name", "flag_note", "datemodify", "datesubmit", "cso", "space_type", "pod", "info"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The name of the supervisor representing the district the space is located", "", "", "", "The supervisor district the space is located", "The pricing zone the space falls in", "Whether the space is part of a double or single space pod", "Intersection CNN nearest to the space", "Street segment CNN nearest to the space", "The nearest intersection to the car share space (this is included for ease of discussion (e.g. this space is at Grove and Ashbury, instead of using a nominal address)", "Indicates the nearest nominal address", "Indicates the operational date of the space (this acts as the billing date for invoicing purposes)", "Indicates the work order is complete or not", "", "Indicates the shop crew work order log number (this number is attached to the work order sent to the sign. meter, paint shops necessary for constructing/installing the space)", "Indicates approval by MTA Board or not (\" \")", "Date the space was heard by the MTA Board", "Date of public hearing for space", "If the space is metered, indicates the meter post ID", "Indicates the address range of the street segment on which the space is located", "Street name and street type", "latitude", "longitude", "Indicates a conflict", "Unique identifier for the on-street car sharing space (refers to the CSO and location of the space request, where City CarShare begins with C; Getaround with G; Zipcar with Z.

SUMMARY</strong>\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service \u2013 Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019).  \n \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\">Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer</a></u> for full documentation \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>  \nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated every 10 minutes with the past 48hrs of open and closed calls that have been dispatched. \n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases Over Time", "id": "gyr2-k29z", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: On January 22, 2022, system updates to improve the timeliness and accuracy of San Francisco COVID-19 cases and deaths data were implemented. You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.  Due to the changes, starting on January 22, 2022, the number of new cases reported daily will be higher than under the old system as cases that would have taken longer to process will be reported earlier.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by specimen collection date. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected (the specimen collection date).\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed positive laboratory tests reported to the City. The City then completes quality assurance and other data verification processes. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. Daily case totals on previous days may increase or decrease. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/San-Francisco-COVID-19-Data-Questions/nudz-9tg2/\">Learn more</a>. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 AM Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 AM and 09:00 AM in case of pipeline failure.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases by specimen collection date. Specimen collection date is the date the positive test was collected (the date the person was tested).\n\nNew cases are the count of cases where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. Cumulative cases are the running total of all San Francisco cases up to the specimen collection date listed.\n\nUse <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/j7i3-u9ke\">the Cases by Population Characteristics dataset</a> to see cases by different subgroups including race/ethnicity, age, gender, and homelessness.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T14:03:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T17:50:36.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:03:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:03:28.000Z", "columns_name": ["Specimen Collection Date", "New Cases", "Cumulative Cases", "Data As Of", "Data Loaded At"], "columns_field_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "new_cases", "cumulative_cases", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The date the positive test was collected (the date the person was tested)", "Cases are counted as confirmed on the date of specimen collection after a positive lab test result", "Cumulative Cases", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Timestamp when data entered the Socrata System"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-08T17:51:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/gyr2-k29z", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-Over-Time/gyr2-k29z", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Dwelling Unit Completion Counts by Building Permit", "id": "j67f-aayr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "A. SUMMARY \n\nThis dataset reports the number of new residential units made available for occupancy in San Francisco since January 2018. Each row in this dataset shows the change in the number of new units associated with a building permit application. Each row also includes the date those units were approved for occupancy, the type of document approving them, and their address.\n\nValues in the column [Number of Units Certified] can be added together to produce a count of new units approved for occupancy since January 2018. \n\nThese records provide a preliminary count of new residential units. The San Francisco Planning Department issues a Housing Inventory Report each year that provides a more complete account of new residential units, and those results may vary slightly from records in this dataset. The Housing Inventory Report is an in-depth annual research project requiring extensive work to validate information about projects. By comparison, this dataset is meant to provide more timely updates about housing production based on available administrative data. The Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department will reconcile these records with future Housing Inventory Reports.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY \n\nAt the end of each month, DBI staff manually calculate how many new units are available for occupancy for each building permit application and enters that information into this dataset. These records reflect counts for all types of residential units, including authorized accessory dwelling units. These records do not reflect units demolished or removed from the city\u2019s available housing stock.\n\nMultiple records may be associated with the same building permit application number, which means that new certifications or amendments were issued. Only changes to the net number of units associated with that permit application are recorded in subsequent records. \n\nFor example, Building Permit Application Number [201601010001] located at [123 1st Avenue] was issued an [Initial TCO] Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on [January 1, 2018] approving 10 units for occupancy. Then, an [Amended TCO] was issued on [June 1, 2018] approving [5] additional units for occupancy, for a total of 15 new units associated with that Building Permit Application Number. The building will appear as twice in the dataset, each row representing when new units were approved.\n\nIf additional or amended certifications are issued for a building permit application, but they do not change the number of units associated with that building permit application, those certifications are not recorded in this dataset. For example, if all new units associated with a project are certified for occupancy under an Initial TCO, then the Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) would not appear in the dataset because the CFC would not add new units to the housing stock.\nSee data definitions for more details.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY \n\nThis dataset is updated monthly.\n\nD. DOCUMENT TYPES\n\nSeveral documents issued near or at project completion can certify units for occupation. They are: Initial Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), Amended TCO, and Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). \n\n\u2022\tInitial TCO is a document that allows for occupancy of a unit before final project completion is certified, conditional on if the unit can be occupied safely. The TCO is meant to be temporary and has an expiration date.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases by Population Characteristics Over Time", "id": "j7i3-u9ke", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: As of March 2022, the race/ethnicity label changed from Native American to American Indian or Alaska Native to align with the Census.\n\nNote: On January 22, 2022, system updates to improve the timeliness and accuracy of San Francisco COVID-19 cases and deaths data were implemented. You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.  Due to the changes, starting on January 22, 2022, the number of new cases reported daily will be higher than under the old system as cases that would have taken longer to process will be reported earlier.  \n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 cases by population characteristics and by specimen collection date. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how cases have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is 5 days prior to today. Tests take time to process and report, so more recent data is less reliable.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 cases and deaths are from: \n* Case interviews \n* Laboratories \n* Medical providers \n\nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. Daily case totals on previous days may increase or decrease. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/s/nudz-9tg2/\">Learn more</a></u>. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19.\n\nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u>\n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n* The population estimates for the \"Other\" or \u201cMulti-racial\u201d groups should be considered with caution. The Census definition is likely not exactly aligned with how the City collects this data. For that reason, we do not recommend calculating population rates for these groups.\n\n<u> Sexual orientation</u>\n* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable.\n* The City doesn\u2019t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age.\n* Case investigation interviews transitioned to the California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant information gathering beginning December 2021. The Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old.<u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf\"> Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation</a></u>. \n\n<u> Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a>. \n\n<u> Comorbidities</u>\n* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death.\n\n<u> Transmission type</u> \n* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.\n\n<u>Homelessness</u> \nPersons are identified as homele", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T14:03:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T18:23:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:02:51.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:03:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["Specimen Collection Date", "Characteristic Type", "Characteristic Group", "Characteristic Group Sort Order", "New Cases", "Cumulative Cases", "Population Estimate", "Data As Of", "Data Loaded At"], "columns_field_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group", "characteristic_group_sort_order", "new_cases", "cumulative_cases", "population_estimate", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The date the positive test was collected (the date the person was tested)", "Overall topic area for a given population characteristic.

The latest adoption FRRM flood map was adopted on July 2020. This adoption was also based on the July 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map analysis because this represents the latest analysis of the floodplain. No changes have occurred in the geographic extent of the flood plain map since 2019.\n\nAreas within this boundary are highly likely to experience \u201cdeep and contiguous\u201d flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. \u201cDeep and contiguous flooding\u201d means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of half an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm, or areas of the City that may flood in storms larger than a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean.

{"resource": {"name": "Covid-19 Tests by Race Ethnicity and Date", "id": "kja3-qsky", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: As of March 2022, the race/ethnicity label changed from Native American to American Indian or Alaska Native to align with the Census.\n\nNote: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.\n\nNote: As of February 2022, the way race/ethnicity is categorized has been changed. See Section B for additional information.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes San Francisco COVID-19 tests by race/ethnicity and by date. This dataset represents the daily count of tests collected, and the breakdown of test results (positive, negative, or indeterminate). Tests in this dataset include all those collected from persons who listed San Francisco as their home address at the time of testing. It also includes tests that were collected by San Francisco providers for persons who were missing a locating address. This dataset does not include tests for residents listing a locating address outside of San Francisco, even if they were tested in San Francisco. \n\nThe data were de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). If a person tested multiple times on the same date, only one test is included from that date. When there are multiple tests on the same date, a positive result, if one exists, will always be selected as the record for the person. If a PCR and antigen test are taken on the same day, the PCR test will supersede. If a person tests multiple times on the same day and the results are all the same (e.g. all negative or all positive) then the first test done is selected as the record for the person.\n\n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated by the health department. While the city tries to only report on tests for San Francisco residents (or tests in San Francisco for those with no locating address listed), some test results purported to be for San Francisco residents are actually for people living outside the city. This can be discovered during a case investigation or data quality assurance. In such an instance, the test would be counted as a positive test in the SF data but would not be counted as a COVID-19 case in San Francisco. If a person tests positive for COVID-19 on different dates, they would be included each of those times in the testing data but only one case. To track the number of cases by race/ethnicity, see this dashboard:\nhttps://sf.gov/data/covid-19-population-characteristics#race-or-ethnicity-\n\nWhen a person gets tested for COVID-19, they may be asked to report information about themselves. One piece of information that might be requested is a person's race and ethnicity. These data are often incomplete in the laboratory and provider reports of the test results sent to the health department. The data can be missing or incomplete for several possible reasons:\n\n\t\u2022 The person was not asked about their race and ethnicity.\n\t\u2022 The person was asked, but refused to answer.\n\t\u2022 The person answered, but the testing provider did not include the person's answers in the reports.\n\t\u2022 The testing provider reported the person's answers in a format that could not be used by the health department.\n\nFor any of these reasons, a person's race/ethnicity will be recorded in the dataset as \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\n<strong>B. NOTE ON RACE/ETHNICITY</strong>\nThe different values for Race/Ethnicity in this dataset are \"Asian;\" \"Black or African American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" \"White;\" \"Multi-racial;\" \"Other;\" and \u201cUnknown.\"\n\nOn February 10, 2022, the method for which race/ethnicity is categorized was updated for the sake of data accuracy, clarity, and stability.

You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. Deaths are included on the date the individual died.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 deaths are suspected to be associated with COVID-19. This means COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death or significant condition on the death certificate.  \n\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: \n* Case interviews \n* Laboratories \n* Medical providers \n\nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. It takes time to process this data. Because of this, data is lagged by 5 days and death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u> \n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n\n<u> Sexual orientation</u> \n* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable.\n* The City doesn\u2019t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age.\n* Case investigation interviews transitioned to Virtual Assistant information gathering starting December 2021. The California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old.<u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf\"> Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation</a></u>. \n\nGender\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a></u>. \n\n<u> Comorbidities</u> \n* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death.\n\n<u> Transmission type</u> \n* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.\n\n<u> Homelessness</u> \n Persons are identified as homeless based on several data sources: \n     * self-reported living situation  \n     * the location at the time of testing \n     * Department of Public Health homelessness and health databases \n     * Residents in Single-Room Occupancy hotels are not included in these figures.  \nThese methods serve as an estimate of persons experiencing homelessness. They may not meet other homelessness definitions. \n\n<u> Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) occupancy</u> \n* A Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) is a type of lo", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T14:02:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T18:42:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:02:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T14:02:24.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date of Death", "Characteristic Type", "Characteristic Group", "Characteristic Group Sort Order", "New Deaths", "Cumulative Deaths", "Data As Of", "Data Loaded At"], "columns_field_name": ["date_of_death", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group", "characteristic_group_sort_order", "new_deaths", "cumulative_deaths", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Date of Death", "Overall topic area for a given population characteristic.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

We have removed sensitive information from this data \u2013 this is intended to show payments made to entities providing goods and services to the City and County and to protect individuals. For example, we have removed payments to employees (reimbursements, garnishments) and jury members, revenue refunds, payments for judgments and claims, witnesses, relocation and rehousing, and a variety of human services payments. New data is added on a weekly basis.\n\nCity Department spending may occur three ways: 1) from Contract to Purchase Order (i.e. a PO with an accounting Encumbrance) to Payment (i.e. an accounting Voucher), AKA On-Contract spending, 2) direct-to-Purchase Order (no contract, only a PO agreement and accounting Encumbrance) to Payment, and 3) Direct Voucher Payment (for limited one-time, non-recurring payments, e.g. a membership or a subscription).  Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.\n\nSupplier payments represent payments to City contractors and vendors that provide goods and/or services to the City.

SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments.

This dataset combines all schedules, pages, and includes unitemized totals. Only transactions from the \"most recent\" version of a filing (original/amendment) appear here.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics

{"resource": {"name": "Covid-19 Testing by Geography and Date", "id": "qhc5-mubk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.\n\nIn recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)\n\nPercentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020\nMar - 33.6%\nApr - 25.9%\nMay - 11.1%\nJun - 7.2%\nJul - 5.8%\nAug - 5.4%\nSep - 5.1%\nOct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%\n\nTo protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).\n\nTests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.\n\nThis data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). \n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/Map-of-Cumulative-Cases/adm5-wq8i#new-cases-map\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\n\">analysis neighborhood</a> and specimen collection date.\n\nData are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. \n\nIn order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"specimen_collection_date\".\n\nCalculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive.

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\u2022 Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\nAll survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the \u201cweight\u201d field when appropriate in your analysis.\n\nThe survey period for this survey is as follows:\n2019: May - August 2019\n\nThe margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.\n\nAt the 95% confidence level is:\n\u2022 n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%\n\u2022 n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%\n\u2022 n = 100.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis data set includes all of the publicly-sited works in the Civic Art Collection, which includes historic monuments, murals, and artworks commissioned through the City's Public Art Program. The data set includes the following categories: artist name, title of work, medium, dimensions and location. The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in.

SUMMARY</strong>\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: On February 23, 2022, the New Cases Map dashboard began pulling from this dataset. To access Cases by Geography and Date, please refer to this dataset: https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Geography-and-Date/d2ef-idww\n\nNote: On January 22, 2022, system updates to improve the timeliness and accuracy of San Francisco COVID-19 cases and deaths data were implemented. You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.  Due to the changes, starting on January 22, 2022, the number of new cases reported daily will be higher than under the old system as cases that would have taken longer to process will be reported earlier. \n\n<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2019 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to ([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.\n\n<em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em>\nA single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is meant to serve as an official record of the Healthy Streets Operations Center's (HSOC) daily tent counts within the Tenderloin neighborhood. These counts track the City's progress towards fulfilling its commitment to reduce tents in the Tenderloin by 70% of the number observed during a tent count conducted on June 5th. HSOC began operations to move unsheltered individuals into Shelter-in-Place (SIP) hotel rooms on June 10th.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nUrban Alchemy, a community organization under contract with the Department of Public Works, takes a daily census of tents within the Tenderloin neighborhood. This data is then validated and processed by City staff and presented here. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be used to monitor the number of tents in the Tenderloin and track progress of efforts to ensure that all residents have a safer place to sleep (like safe sleeping villages, hotels, and other shelters).\n\nSee more data on the Tenderloin COVID Response Plan here: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/Tenderloin-Plan-Data-and-Reporting/sc96-u6ry/", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T13:05:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-06-30T17:35:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-09T13:05:12.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T13:05:13.000Z", "columns_name": ["DATE", "TOTAL"], "columns_field_name": ["date", "total"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date of tent count", "Total number of tents counted"], "columns_format": [{}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-07-01T15:28:34.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "finance", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": ["encampment", "homeless", "homeless count", "homelessness", "safe sleeping", "tenderloin", "tenderloin-soma", "tent", "tent count"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Other"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Neighborhood"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/ubjr-y9qw", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/Tenderloin-Tent-Count/ubjr-y9qw", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Super60_int", "Shady_Clay_int", "Sandy_Soil", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Thrifty150", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Super60", "Top20_int", "Water_Needs", "Top20", "Thrifty150_int", "Habitat_int", "Former_Latin_Name", "Latin_Name", "Common_Name", "Family_Name", "Plant_Type", "Bloom_Time", "Flower_Color", "Size_at_Maturity", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Plant_Communities", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Soil_Type", "Pruning_Needs", "Habitat_Value", "Associated_Wildlife", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Stormwater_int", "Appropriate_Location", "Street_Tree_List", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "Nurseries", "PhotoCredit01", "PhotoCredit02", "PhotoCredit03", "PhotoCredit04", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "Special_List", "Habitat", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Shady_Clay"], "columns_field_name": ["super60_int", "shady_clay_int", "sandy_soil", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "thrifty150", "sandy_soil_int", "super60", "top20_int", "water_needs", "top20", "thrifty150_int", "habitat_int", "former_latin_name", "latin_name", "common_name", "family_name", "plant_type", "bloom_time", "flower_color", "size_at_maturity", "climate_appropriate_plants", "plant_communities", "suitable_site_conditions", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "soil_type", "pruning_needs", "habitat_value", "associated_wildlife", "stormwater_benefit", "stormwater_int", "appropriate_location", "street_tree_list", "additional_characteristices_notes", "nurseries", "photocredit01", "photocredit02", "photocredit03", "photocredit04", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "special_list", "habitat", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "shady_clay"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T15:17:50.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-06T02:15:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:47.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:17:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["TOTAL_1ST_DOSES", "TOTAL_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "TOTAL_SERIES_COMPLETED", "MAX_DATE_ADMINISTERED", "TOTAL_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "AGE_GROUP", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "OVERALL_SEGMENT", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "DATA_AS_OF", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "TOTAL_BOOSTER_DOSES", "TOTAL_2ND_DOSES", "TOTAL_SINGLE_DOSES", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION"], "columns_field_name": ["total_1st_doses", "total_recipients", "data_loaded_at", "total_series_completed", "max_date_administered", "total_booster_recipients", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order", "demographic_subgroup", "age_group", "administering_provider_type", "overall_segment", "data_updated_at", "data_as_of", "age_group_population", "demographic_group", "total_booster_doses", "total_2nd_doses", "total_single_doses", "subgroup_population"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": [" Total number of first doses administered", " Total number of unique vaccine recipients", "Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Total number of individuals that have completed their primary vaccine series ", "Data includes vaccine doses administered through this date", "Total number of unique booster recipients", "Numeric sort order for all DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUPs.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics Over Time", "id": "xjh5-h442", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to San Francisco residents over time. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T15:18:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-11T21:56:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:18:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T15:18:56.000Z", "columns_name": ["DATE_ADMINISTERED", "CUMULATIVE_SINGLE_DOSES", "NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED", "OVERALL_SEGMENT", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "AGE_GROUP", "DATA_AS_OF", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "CUMULATIVE_SERIES_COMPLETED", "NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "NEW_1ST_DOSES", "NEW_SINGLE_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "CUMULATIVE_1ST_DOSES", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION", "NEW_RECIPIENTS", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER", "NEW_2ND_DOSES", "CUMULATIVE_2ND_DOSES"], "columns_field_name": ["date_administered", "cumulative_single_doses", "new_series_completed", "overall_segment", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "age_group", "data_as_of", "demographic_group", "cumulative_booster_doses", "administering_provider_type", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_series_completed", "new_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "new_1st_doses", "new_single_doses", "cumulative_recipients", "data_loaded_at", "cumulative_1st_doses", "subgroup_population", "new_recipients", "demographic_subgroup", "age_group_population", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order", "new_2nd_doses", "cumulative_2nd_doses"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date vaccination administered", "Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Count of individuals that have newly completed their primary vaccine series on a given day", " Segment (universe) of analysis.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-09T07:32:47.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-01T17:15:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-09T07:32:47.000Z", "columns_name": ["Dataset Name", "Department or Division", "Automated By", "Department Priority", "Date Added", "Lag", "Status Notes", "Dataset ID", "Natively Hosted", "Dataset Description", "Metadata Complete", "Dataset Link", "Data Classification", "On Time", "Value", "First Published", "Publishing Approach", "Category", "Lag Days", "Data Dictionary or Equivalent", "Required Fields Complete", "Inventory ID", "Publishing Status", "Date Created on Platform"], "columns_field_name": ["dataset_name", "department_or_division", "automated_by", "department_priority", "date_added", "lag", "status_notes", "dataset_id", "natively_hosted", "dataset_description", "metadata_complete", "dataset_link", "data_classification", "on_time", "value", "first_published", "publishing_approach", "category", "lag_days", "data_dictionary", "required_fields_complete", "inventory_id", "publishing_status", "date_created_on_platform"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Checkbox", "URL", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The name of the dataset.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.
