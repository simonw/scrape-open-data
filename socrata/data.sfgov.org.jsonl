SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments.

This dataset combines all schedules, pages, and includes unitemized totals. Only transactions from the \"most recent\" version of a filing (original/amendment) appear here.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics

UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, blocklot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from here: https://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-01-22T00:03:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-01-21T21:55:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-01-22T00:03:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-01-21T22:12:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Longitude", "Latitude", "SUD", "PDA", "HEIGHT_BUL", "ZONING", "PLANS", "NHOOD_41", "NHOOD_37", "SD", "PD", "QTR", "CONTACTPH", "CONTACT", "PLANNER", "HOTEL_RO_2", "HOTEL_RO_1", "VISITNET", "VISIT_EXIS", "RETNET", "RET", "RET_EXIST", "PDRNET", "PDR_EXIST", "MIPSNET", "MIPS", "MIPS_EXIST", "MED", "CIENET", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "SECTION415", "AFFORDAB_1", "AFFORDABLE", "Pipeline_U", "UNITSNET", "TCO_Unit", "TCO_date", "BESTDATE", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "OBJECTID", "the_geom", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Current Police Districts", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "CIE", "TCOCFC_Uni", "Entitled", "TCOCFC_Dat", "MEDNET", "HOTEL_ROOM", "DA", "DESCRIPT", "YEAR_QTR", "VISIT", "PDR", "RESTAURANT", "LEGALIZATI", "ADU", "RESTAURA_1", "CASENO", "YEAR_", "MED_EXIST", "UNITS", "DBIDESC", "BESTSTAT", "CIE_EXIST", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYP", "SPONSOR", "LANDUSE"], "columns_field_name": ["longitude", "latitude", "sud", "pda", "height_bul", "zoning", "plans", "nhood_41", "nhood_37", "sd", "pd", "qtr", "contactph", "contact", "planner", "hotel_ro_2", "hotel_ro_1", "visitnet", "visit_exis", "retnet", "ret", "ret_exist", "pdrnet", "pdr_exist", "mipsnet", "mips", "mips_exist", "med", "cienet", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "section415", "affordab_1", "affordable", "pipeline_u", "unitsnet", "tco_unit", "tco_date", "bestdate", "nameaddr", "blklot", "objectid", "the_geom", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "cie", "tcocfc_uni", "entitled", "tcocfc_dat", "mednet", "hotel_room", "da", "descript", "year_qtr", "visit", "pdr", "restaurant", "legalizati", "adu", "restaura_1", "caseno", "year_", "med_exist", "units", "dbidesc", "beststat", "cie_exist", "aff_target", "tenure_typ", "sponsor", "landuse"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'the_geom' is located.

{"resource": {"name": "Covid-19 Testing by Geography and Date", "id": "qhc5-mubk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.\n\nIn recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)\n\nPercentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020\nMar - 33.6%\nApr - 25.9%\nMay - 11.1%\nJun - 7.2%\nJul - 5.8%\nAug - 5.4%\nSep - 5.1%\nOct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%\n\nTo protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).\n\nTests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.\n\nThis data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). \n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/Map-of-Cumulative-Cases/adm5-wq8i#new-cases-map\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\n\">analysis neighborhood</a> and specimen collection date.\n\nData are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. \n\nIn order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"specimen_collection_date\".\n\nCalculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive.

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\u2022 Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\nAll survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the \u201cweight\u201d field when appropriate in your analysis.\n\nThe survey period for this survey is as follows:\n2019: May - August 2019\n\nThe margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.\n\nAt the 95% confidence level is:\n\u2022 n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%\n\u2022 n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%\n\u2022 n = 100.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis data set includes all of the publicly-sited works in the Civic Art Collection, which includes historic monuments, murals, and artworks commissioned through the City's Public Art Program. The data set includes the following categories: artist name, title of work, medium, dimensions and location. The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in.

SUMMARY</strong>\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note: On February 23, 2022, the New Cases Map dashboard began pulling from this dataset. To access Cases by Geography and Date, please refer to this dataset: https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Geography-and-Date/d2ef-idww\n\nNote: On January 22, 2022, system updates to improve the timeliness and accuracy of San Francisco COVID-19 cases and deaths data were implemented. You might see some fluctuations in historic data as a result of this change.  Due to the changes, starting on January 22, 2022, the number of new cases reported daily will be higher than under the old system as cases that would have taken longer to process will be reported earlier. \n\n<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2019 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to ([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.\n\n<em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em>\nA single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is meant to serve as an official record of the Healthy Streets Operations Center's (HSOC) daily tent counts within the Tenderloin neighborhood. These counts track the City's progress towards fulfilling its commitment to reduce tents in the Tenderloin by 70% of the number observed during a tent count conducted on June 5th. HSOC began operations to move unsheltered individuals into Shelter-in-Place (SIP) hotel rooms on June 10th.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nUrban Alchemy, a community organization under contract with the Department of Public Works, takes a daily census of tents within the Tenderloin neighborhood. This data is then validated and processed by City staff and presented here. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be used to monitor the number of tents in the Tenderloin and track progress of efforts to ensure that all residents have a safer place to sleep (like safe sleeping villages, hotels, and other shelters).\n\nSee more data on the Tenderloin COVID Response Plan here: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/Tenderloin-Plan-Data-and-Reporting/sc96-u6ry/", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-22T13:05:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-06-30T17:35:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-22T13:05:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-22T13:05:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["TOTAL", "DATE"], "columns_field_name": ["total", "date"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Total number of tents counted", "Date of tent count"], "columns_format": [{}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-07-01T15:28:34.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "finance", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": ["encampment", "homeless", "homeless count", "homelessness", "safe sleeping", "tenderloin", "tenderloin-soma", "tent", "tent count"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Other"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Neighborhood"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/ubjr-y9qw", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/Tenderloin-Tent-Count/ubjr-y9qw", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Former_Latin_Name", "Common_Name", "Family_Name", "Stormwater_int", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Associated_Wildlife", "Sandy_Soil", "Shady_Clay_int", "Shady_Clay", "Super60_int", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Habitat", "Special_List", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "PhotoCredit04", "PhotoCredit03", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Thrifty150", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Habitat_Value", "Pruning_Needs", "Soil_Type", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Plant_Communities", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Size_at_Maturity", "Flower_Color", "Bloom_Time", "Plant_Type", "Super60", "PhotoCredit01", "Nurseries", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "Street_Tree_List", "Appropriate_Location", "Top20_int", "Water_Needs", "Top20", "Thrifty150_int", "Habitat_int", "Latin_Name", "PhotoCredit02"], "columns_field_name": ["former_latin_name", "common_name", "family_name", "stormwater_int", "stormwater_benefit", "associated_wildlife", "sandy_soil", "shady_clay_int", "shady_clay", "super60_int", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "habitat", "special_list", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "photocredit04", "photocredit03", "sandy_soil_int", "thrifty150", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "habitat_value", "pruning_needs", "soil_type", "suitable_site_conditions", "plant_communities", "climate_appropriate_plants", "size_at_maturity", "flower_color", "bloom_time", "plant_type", "super60", "photocredit01", "nurseries", "additional_characteristices_notes", "street_tree_list", "appropriate_location", "top20_int", "water_needs", "top20", "thrifty150_int", "habitat_int", "latin_name", "photocredit02"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics", "id": "wv2h-rqwk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note April 2022: We have identified and corrected an issue with our data processing. You will notice an increase in vaccination numbers and percentages as a result of this correction. \n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. As of December 21, 2021, four dose types are being counted separately, i.e.  (1) first doses administered as a part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, (2) second doses administered as part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, and (3) single-dose vaccines administered as part of a one-dose primary vaccinations series, and (4) booster doses regardless of primary vaccine type (can include more than one booster dose per recipient).\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-21T15:18:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-06T02:15:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-21T15:18:11.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-21T15:18:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["TOTAL_RECIPIENTS", "TOTAL_SERIES_COMPLETED", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "DATA_AS_OF", "OVERALL_SEGMENT", "MAX_DATE_ADMINISTERED", "TOTAL_2ND_DOSES", "TOTAL_SINGLE_DOSES", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "AGE_GROUP", "TOTAL_1ST_DOSES", "TOTAL_BOOSTER_DOSES", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER", "TOTAL_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "DATA_LOADED_AT"], "columns_field_name": ["total_recipients", "total_series_completed", "administering_provider_type", "age_group_population", "demographic_group", "data_as_of", "overall_segment", "max_date_administered", "total_2nd_doses", "total_single_doses", "demographic_subgroup", "age_group", "total_1st_doses", "total_booster_doses", "subgroup_population", "data_updated_at", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order", "total_booster_recipients", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": [" Total number of unique vaccine recipients", "Total number of individuals fully vaccinated (those having received the second dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine)", "Providers included in a given OVERALL_SEGMENT.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics Over Time", "id": "xjh5-h442", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Note April 2022: We have identified and corrected an issue with our data processing. You will notice an increase in vaccination numbers and percentages as a result of this correction. \n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to San Francisco residents over time. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. As of December 21, 2021, four dose types are counted separately, i.e.  (1) first doses administered as a part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, (2) second doses administered as part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, and (3) single-dose vaccines administered as part of a one-dose primary series, and (4) booster doses regardless of primary vaccine type.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cairweb.org/about-cair/\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.\n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false\">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/\">our public dashboards</a>. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.\n\nFor example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.\n\nIf you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to \"Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco\u2019s Department of Public Health (DPH).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-21T15:19:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-11T21:56:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-21T15:19:08.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-21T15:19:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["CUMULATIVE_SERIES_COMPLETED", "CUMULATIVE_SINGLE_DOSES", "DATE_ADMINISTERED", "CUMULATIVE_2ND_DOSES", "NEW_2ND_DOSES", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP_SORT_ORDER", "AGE_GROUP_POPULATION", "DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUP", "NEW_RECIPIENTS", "SUBGROUP_POPULATION", "CUMULATIVE_1ST_DOSES", "DATA_LOADED_AT", "CUMULATIVE_RECIPIENTS", "NEW_SINGLE_DOSES", "NEW_1ST_DOSES", "DATA_UPDATED_AT", "NEW_BOOSTER_DOSES", "OVERALL_SEGMENT", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS", "AGE_GROUP", "NEW_SERIES_COMPLETED", "DATA_AS_OF", "CUMULATIVE_BOOSTER_DOSES", "ADMINISTERING_PROVIDER_TYPE", "DEMOGRAPHIC_GROUP", "NEW_BOOSTER_RECIPIENTS"], "columns_field_name": ["cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_single_doses", "date_administered", "cumulative_2nd_doses", "new_2nd_doses", "demographic_subgroup_sort_order", "age_group_population", "demographic_subgroup", "new_recipients", "subgroup_population", "cumulative_1st_doses", "data_loaded_at", "cumulative_recipients", "new_single_doses", "new_1st_doses", "data_updated_at", "new_booster_doses", "overall_segment", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "age_group", "new_series_completed", "data_as_of", "cumulative_booster_doses", "administering_provider_type", "demographic_group", "new_booster_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Cumulative total individuals fully vaccinated (given the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single dose vaccine)", "Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete", "Date vaccination administered", "Cumulative total of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Count of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete", "Numeric sort order for all DEMOGRAPHIC_SUBGROUPs.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-22T07:35:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-01T17:15:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-22T07:35:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["Automated By", "Lag", "Dataset Description", "Category", "Department or Division", "Status Notes", "Dataset ID", "Date Added", "Department Priority", "Data Classification", "First Published", "Inventory ID", "Dataset Name", "Date Created on Platform", "Publishing Approach", "Data Dictionary or Equivalent", "Required Fields Complete", "Publishing Status", "Dataset Link", "Metadata Complete", "Natively Hosted", "On Time", "Lag Days", "Value"], "columns_field_name": ["automated_by", "lag", "dataset_description", "category", "department_or_division", "status_notes", "dataset_id", "date_added", "department_priority", "data_classification", "first_published", "inventory_id", "dataset_name", "date_created_on_platform", "publishing_approach", "data_dictionary", "required_fields_complete", "publishing_status", "dataset_link", "metadata_complete", "natively_hosted", "on_time", "lag_days", "value"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "URL", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["For datasets that are published and automated, who is doing the automating.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.
