{"resource": {"name": "Cook County Budgeted Position Salaries", "id": "h548-w4m3", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains information on estimated proposed salaries by position for all Cook County employees excluding the Forest Preserves of Cook County. Salaries are budgeted based on the fiscal year which is the 12 month period that begins on December 1 and ends on November 30 of the succeeding year. The Budgeted Salary does not include fringe benefits such as Medical Insurance, Dental Insurance, etc. The Budgeted Salary and position title may change throughout the fiscal year; any such changes will not be updated in this dataset.\n  \nIt may be helpful to know the Job Code contained in the dataset is a unique 4-digit number assigned to each specific Job Title while the Position ID is a unique 8-digit number that identifies a position. This helps create consistency and accuracy in the dataset over time, in case of a name change or other change. \n\nCook County voluntarily provides this dataset as a service to the public.
