Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-11T14:19:53.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-13T17:07:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-11T14:19:53.000Z", "columns_name": [" DESCRIPTION", "REGION", " WEST", " SOUTH", " EAST", " REGION_ID", " LAST_UPDATED", " CURRENT_SPEED", " NORTH"], "columns_field_name": ["_description", "region", "_west", "_south", "_east", "_region_id", "_last_updt", "current_speed", "_north"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Description of the region.", "Name of the region.", "Approximate longitude of the west edge of the region.", "Approximate latitude of the south edge of the region.", "Approximate longitude of the east edge of the region.", "Unique arbitrary number to represent each region.", "Timestamp of the last update.", "Estimated congestion level.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes - Vehicles", "id": "68nd-jvt3", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains information about vehicles (or units as they are identified in crash reports) involved in a traffic crash. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. \u201cVehicle\u201d information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record.

There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

This dataset should be used in combination with the traffic Crash and Vehicle dataset. Each record corresponds to an occupant in a vehicle listed in the Crash dataset. Some people involved in a crash may not have been an occupant in a motor vehicle, but may have been a pedestrian, bicyclist, or using another non-motor vehicle mode of transportation. Injuries reported are reported by the responding police officer. Fatalities that occur after the initial reports are typically updated in these records up to 30 days after the date of the crash. Person data can be linked with the Crash and Vehicle dataset using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field. A vehicle can have multiple occupants and hence have a one to many relationship between Vehicle and Person dataset. However, a pedestrian is a \u201cunit\u201d by itself and have a one to one relationship between the Vehicle and Person table.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Police Department reports crashes on IL Traffic Crash Reporting form SR1050.

For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n TANK TYPE:  Specifies if the asset is an Underground Storage Tank or an Aboveground Storage Tank.  \r\nFACILITY ID: This is the unique identifier of the facility. A UST Facility ID that is seven digits long and begins with the number \u20182\u2019 is a Facility ID assigned by the Office of the State Fire Marshall (OSFM). All other IDs were assigned by the DOE or CDPH based on the facility address.   \r\nOWNER: The owner of record for the tank. For State-regulated USTs, this is the owner registered with the OSFM. \r\nFACILITY NAME: This is the name given to the facility. This is usually the company/owner name, building name or address.  \r\nTANK ID: This is a numeric ID that uniquely identifies a particular tank at the facility. \r\nTANK MATERIAL: Specifies the type of material the tank is made of. \r\nTANK PRODUCT: Specifies the type of product stored in the tank.    \r\nTANK CAPACITY: This is the storage volume of the tank in gallons. \r\nINSTALLATION DATE: The date the tank was installed at the facility if known. For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nREMOVAL DATE: The date the tank was removed from the facility if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nLAST USED DATE: The date the tank was last in service if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nCOMMENT: Contains additional information on the tank that may include supplemental location information; field observations; removal, abandonment, or last used dates; permitting notes; and other miscellaneous information. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-29T11:58:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2012-08-28T16:59:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-29T11:58:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-29T11:53:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["COMMENT", "LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE", "DATA SOURCE", "LAST USED DATE", "REMOVAL DATE", "INSTALLATION DATE", "TANK CAPACITY", "TANK PRODUCT", "TANK CONSTRUCTION", "STREET NUMBER TO", "TANK MATERIAL", "Tank ID", "STREET NUMBER FROM", "ADDRESS", "Wards", "Census Tracts", "Zip Codes", "Community Areas", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "LOCATION", "FACILITY NAME", "OWNER", "FACILITY ID", "TANK TYPE", "STREET TYPE", "STREET NAME", "DIRECTION"], "columns_field_name": ["comment", "longitude", "latitude", "data_source", "last_used_date", "removal_abandoned_date", "installation_date", "tank_capacity", "tank_product", "tank_construction", "street_number_to", "tank_material", "tank_id", "street_number", "address", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", "location", "facility", "applicant", "facility_id", "tank_type", "street_type", "street_name", "direction"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "City department that collected the data.", "", "Removal or abandoned date", "", "In Gallons unless otherwise specified in record.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"align": "left"}, {}, {}, {"align": "left"}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "center"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-29T11:58:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment & Sustainable Development", "domain_tags": ["ast", "tanks", "ust"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Last-Updated-Date-via-Automated-Load", "value": ""}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ug5u-hxnx", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/CDPH-Storage-Tanks/ug5u-hxnx", "owner": {"id": "e3v2-km8a", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Renante"}, "creator": {"id": "e3v2-km8a", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Renante"}}
{"resource": {"name": "Arrests", "id": "dpt3-jri9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Each record in this dataset shows information about an arrest executed by the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

The dataset has also been renamed. See the text below and http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html for specifics. -- This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!\n\nThis is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/reopening-chicago.html#reopeningmetrics.\n\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.\n\nThe National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners, is used to capture information during an Emergency Department (ED) visit.  ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits\u201d to \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits\u201d at the same time.\n\nData Source: Illinois Hospital Emergency Departments reporting to CDPH through the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T14:30:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-10T21:51:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-03T17:08:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T14:30:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Total CLI - Daily", "CLI Percent - 7 day average", "Total COVID - Daily", "COVID Percent - 7 day average", "CLI Count - 7 day average", "Total ED Visits - Daily", "CLI Percent - Daily", "COVID Count - 7 day average", "COVID Percent - Daily", "Date"], "columns_field_name": ["total_cli_daily", "cli_percent_7_day_average", "total_covid_daily", "covid_percent_7_day_average", "cli_count_7_day_average", "total_ed_visits_daily", "cli_percent_daily", "covid_count_7_day_average", "covid_percent_daily", "date"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Total number of CLI ED visits on the date.", "7-day rolling average of CLI percentage", "Total number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed in EDs on the date", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis percentage", "7-day rolling average of CLI counts", "Total number of ED visits on the date.", "Percentage of ED visits attributed to CLI", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis counts", "Percentage of ED visits that are COVID-19 diagnoses", "Date of ED visit"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precision": "0"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"view": "date"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-23T17:38:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health & Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "health", "link to article present", "public health", "syndromic surveillance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated daily."}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "Current through most recent date shown."}, {"key": "Metadata_Changes-and-Other-Historical-Information-Useful-to-Understanding-This-Dataset", "value": "http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qwib-edaw", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-Like-Illness-CLI-and-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Emer/qwib-edaw", "owner": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}, "creator": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}}

Records with a null value in the Contract Type field were imported from legacy systems. \r\n\"Comptroller-Other\" Contract Type: Some records where the Contract Type is \"COMPTROLLER-OTHER\" are ordinance-based agreements and may have start dates earlier than 1993. \r\nDepends Upon Requirements Contracts: If the contract Award Amount is $0, the contract is not cancelled, and the contract is a blanket contract, then the contract award total Depends Upon Requirements. A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/77hq-huss. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-11T14:25:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-28T22:28:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-16T20:46:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-11T14:25:45.000Z", "columns_name": ["SPEED", "BUS_COUNT", "STREET_HEADING", "START_LOCATION", "MONTH", "HOUR", "FROM_STREET", "COMMENTS", "END_LOCATION", "END_LONGITUDE", "END_LATITUDE", "TO_STREET", "RECORD_ID", "START_LONGITUDE", "LENGTH", "Wards", "Zip Codes", "Community Areas", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "START_LATITUDE", "STREET", "DIRECTION", "TIME", "MESSAGE_COUNT", "SEGMENT_ID"], "columns_field_name": ["speed", "bus_count", "street_heading", "start_location", "month", "hour", "from_street", "comments", "end_location", "end_longitude", "end_latitude", "to_street", "record_id", "start_longitude", "length", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", "day_of_week", "start_latitude", "street", "direction", "time", "message_count", "segment_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Estimated traffic speed in miles per hour.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-11T14:19:53.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-13T17:07:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-11T14:19:53.000Z", "columns_name": [" DESCRIPTION", "REGION", " WEST", " SOUTH", " EAST", " REGION_ID", " LAST_UPDATED", " CURRENT_SPEED", " NORTH"], "columns_field_name": ["_description", "region", "_west", "_south", "_east", "_region_id", "_last_updt", "current_speed", "_north"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Description of the region.", "Name of the region.", "Approximate longitude of the west edge of the region.", "Approximate latitude of the south edge of the region.", "Approximate longitude of the east edge of the region.", "Unique arbitrary number to represent each region.", "Timestamp of the last update.", "Estimated congestion level.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)

Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

{"resource": {"name": "Chicago COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)", "id": "xhc6-88s9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Chicago CCVI identifies communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are vulnerable to barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake\u200b. Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.
