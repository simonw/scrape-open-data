This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)\n1990-2021\nhttps://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nQCEW employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers, and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation, and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers from having to report employment data, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness, or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the NAICS supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining, and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%), and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government / public administration, regardless of industry group.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-10T22:50:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-10T00:59:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-10T22:50:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percentchange_1990", "Difference_1990", "Industry", "Geo_Name", "Objectid", "Year", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchange_1990", "difference_1990", "industry", "geo_name", "objectid", "year", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["percentchange_1990", "difference_1990", "Industry", "geo_name", "objectid", "Year", "Source"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-10T00:59:27.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y9r8-pr4c", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Change-in-Jobs-by-Industry-by-County-2/y9r8-pr4c", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T18:05:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:06:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "Wage_Category", "OES_Jobs", "Subregion", "Source", "Jobs_Share"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "wage_category", "oes_jobs", "subregion", "source", "jobs_share"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "Number of jobs by wage category", "", "", "Share of jobs by wage category"], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:06:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/yc3r-a4rh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Subregion/yc3r-a4rh", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

In short, this measure reflects the integrity of regional bridges and overpasses.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:15:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Quadrant", "LQ", "Source", "Jobs", "Year", "PercntChng_1990", "Industry", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["quadrant", "lq", "source", "jobs", "year", "percntchng_1990", "industry", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Quadrant for visualization", "Location quotient", "", "", "", "Percent change in jobs since 1990", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precision": "4"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ysen-ajs2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-Bay/ysen-ajs2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}
