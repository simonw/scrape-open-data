In  most  instances,  Base  Flood  Elevations  derived  from  the  detailed  hydraulic analyses  are  shown  at  selected  intervals  within  this  zone.  Mandatory  flood  insurance  purchase requirements  apply.   AH - Zone  AH  is  the  flood  insurance  rate  zone  that  corresponds  to  the  areas  of  1-percent  annual chance  shallow  flooding with  a  constant  water-surface  elevation  (usually  areas  of  ponding)  where average  depths  are between  1  and  3  feet.  The Base Flood  Elevations  derived  from  the detailed hydraulic  analyses  are  shown  at  selected  intervals  within  this  zone.  Mandatory  flood  insurance purchase  requirements  apply.   AO - Zone  AO  is  the  flood  insurance  rate  zone  that  corresponds  to  the  areas  of  1-percent  shallow flooding  (usually  sheet  flow  on  sloping  terrain)  where  average  depths  are  between  1  and  3  feet. Average  flood  depths  derived  from  the  detailed  hydraulic  analyses  are  shown  within  this  zone.  In addition,  alluvial  fan  flood  hazards  are  shown  as  Zone  AO  on  the  Flood  Insurance  Rate  Map.  Mandatory flood  insurance  purchase  requirements  apply.   AR - Zone AR  is  the flood  insurance rate zone used  to  depict areas  protected  from  flood  hazards  by flood  control  structures,  such  as  a levee,  that  are  being  restored.  FEMA  will  consider using  the  Zone  AR designation  for a  community  if  the  flood  protection  system  has  been  deemed  restorable  by  a  Federal agency  in  consultation  with  a local project  sponsor;  a  minimum  level of  flood  protection  is  still provided  to  the  community  by  the  system;  and  restoration  of  the  flood  protection  system  is  scheduled to  begin  within  a designated  time  period  and  in  accordance  with  a progress  plan  negotiated  between the  community  and  FEMA.  Mandatory  purchase  requirements  for  flood  insurance  will  apply  in  Zone AR,  but  the  rate  will not  exceed  the  rate  for an  unnumbered  Zone  A  if  the  structure  is  built  in compliance  with  Zone  AR  floodplain  management  regulations.

No  Base  Flood  Elevations  or  depths  are  shown  within  this  zone. Mandatory  flood  insurance  purchase  requirements  apply.   D - Zone D designation  is  used  for  areas  where  there  are  possible  but  undetermined  flood  hazards.  In areas  designated  as  Zone  D,  no  analysis  of flood  hazards  has  been  conducted.  Mandatory  flood insurance  purchase  requirements  do  not  apply,  but  coverage  is  available.  The  flood  insurance  rates  for properties  in  Zone  D  are commensurate with  the uncertainty  of  the flood  risk. V -  Zone V  is  the  flood  insurance  rate  zone  that  corresponds  to  areas  within  the  1-percent  annual chance  coastal  floodplains  that  have  additional hazards  associated  with  storm  waves.  Because approximate  hydraulic  analyses  are  performed  for  such  areas,  no  Base  Flood  Elevations  are  shown within  this  zone.  Mandatory  flood  insurance  purchase  requirements  apply. VE  -  Zone  VE  is  the  flood  insurance  rate  zone  that  corresponds  to  areas  within  the  1-percent  annual chance  coastal  floodplain  that  have  additional hazards  associated  with  storm  waves.

{"resource": {"name": "1% Coastal Flood Zone with 3.2 ft Sea Level Rise - Statewide", "id": "qpk2-cm24", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis create waves that flood low-lying coastal areas. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) produces flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) that depict flood risk zones referred to as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) based modeling 1%-annual-chance flood event also referred to as a 100-year flood. The purpose of the FIRM is twofold: (1) to provide the basis for application of regulatory standards and (2) to provide the basis for insurance rating.\n\nSFHAs identify areas at risk from infrequent but severe storm-induced wave events and riverine flood events that are based upon historical record. By law (44 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 60.3), FEMA can only map flood risk that will be utilized for land use regulation or insurance rating based on historical data, therefore, future conditions with sea level rise and other impacts of climate change are not considered in FIRMs. It is important to note that FEMA can produce Flood Insurance Rate Maps that include future condition floodplains, but these would be considered \u201cawareness\u201d zones and not to be used for regulatory of insurance rating purposes.\n\nThe State of Hawai\u2018i 2018 Hazard Mitigation Plan incorporated the results of modeling and an assessment of vulnerability to coastal flooding from storm-induced wave events with sea level rise (Tetra Tech Inc., 2018). The 1% annual-chance-coastal flood zone with sea level rise (1%CFZ) was modeled to estimate coastal flood extents and wave heights for wave-generating events with sea level rise. Modeling was conducted by Sobis Inc. under State of Hawai\u02bbi Department of Land and Natural Resources Contract No: 64064. The 1%CFZ with 3.2 feet of sea level rise was utilized to assess vulnerability to coastal event-based flooding in mid to - late century.\n\nThe 1%CFZ with sea level rise would greatly expand the impacts from a 100-year flood event meaning that more coastal land area will be exposed to damaging waves. For example, over 120 critical infrastructure facilities in the City and County of Honolulu, including water, waste, and wastewater systems and communication and energy facilities would be impacted in the 1%CFZ with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (Tetra Tech Inc., 2018). This is double the number of facilities in the SFHA which includes the impacts of riverine flooding.\n\n\nA simplified version of the Wave Height Analysis for Flood Insurance Studies (WHAFIS) extension (FEMA, 2019b) included in Hazus-MH, was used to create the 1% annual chance coastal floodplain. Hazus is a nationally applicable standardized methodology that contains models for estimating potential losses from earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and hurricanes (FEMA, 2019a). \nThe current 1%-annual-chance stillwater elevations were collected using the most current flood insurance studies (FIS) for each island conducted by FEMA (FEMA, 2004, 2010, 2014, 2015). The FIS calculates the 1%-annual-chance stillwater elevation, wave setup, and wave run-up (called maximum wave crest) at regularly-spaced transects around the islands based on historical data. Modeling for the 1%CFZ used the NOAA 3-meter digital elevation model (DEM) which incorporates LiDAR data sets collected between 2003 and 2007 from NOAA, FEMA, the State of Hawai\u02bbi Emergency Management Agency, and the USACE (NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2017).\nBefore Hazus was run for future conditions, it was run for the current conditions and compared to the FEMA regulatory floodplain to determine model accuracy. This also helped determine the stillwater elevation for the large gaps between some transects in the FIS. Hazus was run at 0.5-foot stillwater level intervals and the results were compared to the existing Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The interval of 0.5-feet was chosen as a small enough step to result in a near approximation of the FIRM while not being too impractically narrow to require the testing of dozens of input elevations.
