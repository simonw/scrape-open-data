The effect would be an increase in crime due to the elimination of the SRS Hierarchy Rule which collected only the most serious offense in an incident while NIBRS will now capture up to 10 offenses per incident and specifies more offense categories than SRS.  The inclusion of these crimes, particularly property crimes, will reflect an increase in crime when switching from SRS reporting to NIBRS' reporting.  The apparent increase (usually not greater than 2.7%) is simply due to the difference between how crimes are counted in NIBRS versus the SRS and its application of the Hierarchy Rule.
