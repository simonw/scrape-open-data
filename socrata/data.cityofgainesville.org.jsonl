{"resource": {"name": "Crime Responses", "id": "gvua-xt9q", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Disclaimer:\nCrime Responses is provided by the Gainesville Police Department (GPD) to document initial details surrounding an incident to which GPD officers respond. This dataset contains crime incidents from 2011 to present and includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well when and where an incident occurred.\nThe Incident location addresses have been rounded off and are not the exact location due to the constitutional amendment known as \"Marsy's Law\".\n\nIn 2021, Florida reporting of crime data began a transition from Summary Reporting System (SRS) to National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), causing an effect on crime statistics reported by Law Enforcement Agencies such as the Gainesville Police Department who made this transition on November 16, 2021.  The effect would be an increase in crime due to the elimination of the SRS Hierarchy Rule which collected only the most serious offense in an incident while NIBRS will now capture up to 10 offenses per incident and specifies more offense categories than SRS.  The inclusion of these crimes, particularly property crimes, will reflect an increase in crime when switching from SRS reporting to NIBRS' reporting.  The apparent increase (usually not greater than 2.7%) is simply due to the difference between how crimes are counted in NIBRS versus the SRS and its application of the Hierarchy Rule.
