{"resource": {"name": "Colonization Records", "id": "t4nd-rm7w", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Colonization records include documents from two government agencies that raised money and support for the removal of formerly enslaved people to Liberia. As early as 1691, the Virginia General Assembly began passing laws that forced free Black Virginians to leave the Commonwealth. Fears around insurrection and the desire to control the Black population gave rise to institutions dedicated to removing free people of color from Virginia. \n \nThe General Assembly passed an act in 1833 \"making appropriations for the removal of free persons of color\" to the western coast of Africa and established a board of commissioners charged with carrying out the provisions of the act. \u201cThe Board of Commissioners for the Removal of Free Persons of Color records, 1833-1856,\u201d contain correspondence, lists, minutes, oaths, and resolutions. Included are lists of free Black individuals who emigrated to Liberia (including the name of the ship), lists of free Black individuals willing to emigrate, and resolutions to send money to the American Colonization Society and to those who transported the free Black people to Liberia. Also included is a report of the Board of Commissioners, 1835, containing a list of free Black people transported to Liberia and including their names, ages, and where they had lived in Virginia.\n \nThe General Assembly passed an act on April 6, 1853 to create the Colonization Board of Virginia, (chap. 55, p. 58). This act also created appropriations to fund the voluntary transportation and removal of free Black individuals to Liberia or elsewhere in West Africa through the efforts of the Virginia branch of the American Colonization Society. Statutory members of the board included the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Auditor of Public Accounts, the Second Auditor of Public Accounts, and four other competent members appointed by the Governor. An annual tax was levied on free Black men between the ages of 21 to 55 to help finance the operations of the board. The Colonization Board was authorized to reimburse the agents of the Virginia Colonization Society for transportation costs only after receiving satisfactory proof that the formerly enslaved individuals had been transported out of the state. The Virginia Colonization Society arranged for the actual passage of free Black individuals, and at each meeting the Board received affidavits for particular free people who had already been transported, along with evidence that the individuals were free or born of free parents, that they were residents of Virginia and that they had already been transported to Africa or that they had embarked to another state for transportation. The Board was required to keep a journal of its proceedings, showing all actions taken and monies disbursed, and was also required to submit a biennial report to the General Assembly showing the name, age, sex, and locality of each person removed. The board held its last meeting on August 14, 1858, after the preceding session of the General Assembly failed to extend its existence. The Virginia Board of Colonization journal of proceedings includes lists of the names and ages of free Black individuals transported from the commonwealth to Africa, as well as the county, city, or borough from which they were transported, and in some instances also includes the name of the ship and names of former enslavers.\n\n\nData in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-17T13:42:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-29T14:10:03.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:42:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:42:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["Surname", "Date (of entry)", "Barcode", "Name of Ship", "File Name", "First Name", "Middle Name", "Suffix", "Gender", "Date Added or Updated", "Town", "Occupation", "Date Ship Sailed", "Method of Emancipation", "Destination", "County/City", "Previous Enslaver", "Name of Parents", "Name of Children", "Name of Spouse", "Age", "Alias"], "columns_field_name": ["surname", "date_of_entry", "barcode", "name_of_ship", "file_name", "first_name", "middle_name", "suffix", "gender", "date_added", "town", "occupation", "date_ship_sailed", "method_of_emancipation", "destination", "county_city", "previous_enslaver", "name_of_parents", "name_of_children", "name_of_spouse", "age", "alias"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Last name of the individual emigating", "Date that the information was recorded ", "Barcode for the box housing the original physical document referenced", "Name of ship emigrating individual traveled on", "File name for the digital version of the document referenced", "First name of the individual emigrating ", "Middle name of the individual emigrating", "Suffix of the individual emigrating", "Recorded gender of the emigrating individual", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Town in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration", "Occupation of emigrating individual", "Date ship sailed", "Method of gaining freedom if emigrating individual was formerly enslaved", "Destination of the emigrating individual", "County/City in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration", "If applicable, name of previous enslaver of emigrating individual", "Name of emigrating individual's parents", "Name of emigrating individual's children if applicable", "Name of emigrating individual's spouse if applicable", "Recorded age of the emigrating individual", "Any aliases or nicknames of the emigrating individual"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-21T17:16:17.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "demographics", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["colonization", "emigration", "liberia", "library of virginia", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/t4nd-rm7w", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Colonization-Records/t4nd-rm7w", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

The collection also includes records with information related to enslaved people from multiple localities who escaped to United States military forces during the Civil War. While many independent businesses bought and sold human beings, local and state governments such as the state of Virginia also participated in and profited from human trafficking. Localities were reimbursed for the expenses of confining, feeding, and selling of self-emancipated people, and likewise, the state established procedures to compensate enslavers for their financial loss when enslaved people ran away or were imprisoned or executed. If a person was captured and their enslaver could not be identified, they became the property of the state and were sold. The proceeds from these sales went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts.

The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-11-23T15:56:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "Locality", "Source", "Date Added or Updated", "Suffix", "Status", "Gender", "Enslaver's First Name", "Surname", "Date", "Enslaver's Surname", "Age", "Barcode", "File Name", "First Name", "Middle Name", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Standardized Cause of Death "], "columns_field_name": ["additional_slave_names", "additional_free_black_names", "locality", "source", "date_added", "suffix", "status", "gender", "owner_first_name", "surname", "date", "owner_surname", "age", "barcode", "file_name", "first_name", "middle_name", "cause_of_death", "cause_of_death_1"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Names of enslaved persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "Names of Free Black persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "County in Virginia where the individual died", "Collection information for the original record", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Suffix to the name of the deceased individual", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.

There are a total of 10 trail counters along the Trail that collect total number of users in each section per day. We can use this data for a number of reasons such as: finding our most popular access point, the busiest times on the Trail, and the distribution of cyclist vs. pedestrian Trail users. Thanks to this technology we're able to showcase just how many people use and enjoy the Trail every day. Not just that, we share our data with other interest groups to help advocate for more trails!", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-09-29T22:44:53.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T22:36:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-09-29T22:44:53.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-09-29T22:43:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["New Georeferenced Column", "Latitude", "Counters", "longitude"], "columns_field_name": ["geocoded_column", "latitude", "counters", "longitude"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-09-29T22:41:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Datathon 2020", "domain_tags": ["recreation"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/yv9b-k8uu", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Datathon-2020/Capital-Trail-Counters-geolocation/yv9b-k8uu", "owner": {"id": "qzq4-6vxd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "K Jordan"}, "creator": {"id": "qzq4-6vxd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "K Jordan"}}
