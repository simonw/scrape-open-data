The collection also includes records with information related to enslaved people from multiple localities who escaped to United States military forces during the Civil War. While many independent businesses bought and sold human beings, local and state governments such as the state of Virginia also participated in and profited from human trafficking. Localities were reimbursed for the expenses of confining, feeding, and selling of self-emancipated people, and likewise, the state established procedures to compensate enslavers for their financial loss when enslaved people ran away or were imprisoned or executed. If a person was captured and their enslaver could not be identified, they became the property of the state and were sold. The proceeds from these sales went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts.

The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-11-23T15:56:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date", "Enslaver's Surname", "Age", "Barcode", "File Name", "First Name", "Middle Name", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Surname", "Enslaver's First Name", "Status", "Gender", "Suffix", "Standardized Cause of Death ", "Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "Locality", "Source", "Date Added or Updated"], "columns_field_name": ["date", "owner_surname", "age", "barcode", "file_name", "first_name", "middle_name", "cause_of_death", "surname", "owner_first_name", "status", "gender", "suffix", "cause_of_death_1", "additional_slave_names", "additional_free_black_names", "locality", "source", "date_added"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Date of death of deceased individual", "If enslaved, the surname of the enslaver of the deceased individual", "Age, sometimes approximated, of deceased individual as noted in original document", "Barcode for the box housing the original physical document referenced", "File name for the digital version of the document referenced", "First name of deceased individual", "Middle name of deceased individual", "Detailed cause of death summarized from the original record", "Surname of deceased individual", "If enslaved, the first name of the enslaver of the deceased individual", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.

Not just that, we share our data with other interest groups to help advocate for more trails!", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-09-29T22:44:53.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T22:36:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-09-29T22:44:53.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-09-29T22:43:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Latitude", "Counters", "longitude", "New Georeferenced Column"], "columns_field_name": ["latitude", "counters", "longitude", "geocoded_column"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Point"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-09-29T22:41:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Datathon 2020", "domain_tags": ["recreation"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/yv9b-k8uu", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Datathon-2020/Capital-Trail-Counters-geolocation/yv9b-k8uu", "owner": {"id": "qzq4-6vxd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "K Jordan"}, "creator": {"id": "qzq4-6vxd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "K Jordan"}}
