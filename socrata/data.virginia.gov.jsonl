Annual averages, numbers in thousands.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Local Area Unemployment Statistics, Expanded State Employment Status Demographic Data\nData accessed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (https://www.bls.gov/lau/ex14tables.htm)\n\nStatewide data on the demographic and economic characteristics of the labor force are published on an annual-average basis from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the sample survey of households used to calculate the U.S. unemployment rate (https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm). For each state and the District of Columbia, employment status data are tabulated for 67 sex, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, marital status, and detailed age categories and evaluated against a minimum base, calculated to reflect an expected maximum coefficient of variation (CV) of 50 percent, to determine reliability for publication.\n\nThe CPS sample was redesigned in 2014\u201315 to reflect the distribution of the population as of the 2010 Census. At the same time, BLS developed improved techniques for calculating minimum bases. These changes resulted in generally higher minimum bases of unemployment, leading to the publication of fewer state-demographic groups beginning in 2015. The most notable impact was on the detailed age categories, particularly the teenage and age 65 and older groups. In an effort to extend coverage, BLS introduced a version of the expanded state employment status demographic table with intermediate age categories, collapsing the seven categories historically included down to three. Ages 16\u201319 and 20\u201324 were combined into a 16\u201324 year-old category, ages 25\u201334, 35\u201344, and 45\u201354 were combined into a 25\u201354 year-old category, and ages 55\u201364 and 65 and older were combined into a 55-years-and-older category. These intermediate age data are tabulated for the total population, as well as the four race and ethnicity groups, and then are evaluated against the unemployment minimum bases. The more detailed age categories continue to be available in the main version of the expanded table, where the minimum base was met.\n\nAdditional information on the uses and limitations of statewide data from the CPS can be found in the document Notes on Using Current Population Survey (https://www.bls.gov/lau/notescps.htm) Subnational Data and in Appendix B of the bulletin Geographic Profile of Employment and Unemployment (https://www.bls.gov/opub/geographic-profile/home.htm).", "attribution": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics", "attribution_link": "https://www.bls.gov/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-07T13:30:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-27T18:13:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-07T13:30:36.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-09-23T17:51:16.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "StateFIPSCode", "StateName", "GroupCode", "PopulationGroup", "CivilianNonInstitutionalPopulation", "CivilianLaborForce", "CivilianLaborForcePercentOfPopulation", "CivilianLaborForceEmployed", "CivilianLaborForceEmployedPercentOfPopulation", "CivilianLaborForceUnemployed", "CivilianLaborForceUnemployedPercentOfPopulation", "ErrorRangeOfRate"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "statefipscode", "statename", "groupcode", "populationgroup", "civiliannoninstitutional", "civilianlaborforce", "civilianlaborforcepercen", "civilianlaborforceemployed", "civilianlaborforceemploy", "civilianlaborforceunemployed", "civilianlaborforceunempl", "errorrangeofrate"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Integer for corresponding Population Group.", "Population or Demographic Group.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-01-29T02:24:51.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "economy", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["employment", "unemployment", "labor statistics", "sex group", "gender", "age group", "race", "ethnicity", "transportation planning", "socioeconomic", "annual", "workforce"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Age", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Gender", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Geographic-Area", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Race/Ethnicity", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Employment-Status", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Responsible-Data-Agency_Other-Agency-Name", "value": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics"}, {"key": "Responsible-Data-Agency_Agency-Website", "value": "https://www.bls.gov/"}, {"key": "Responsible-Data-Agency_Agency-Name", "value": "Other"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/p2ww-25u5", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Economy/Virginia-Employment-Status-of-the-Population-by-Se/p2ww-25u5", "owner": {"id": "kqqj-wum6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Beverly Quinlan"}, "creator": {"id": "kqqj-wum6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Beverly Quinlan"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Colonization Records", "id": "t4nd-rm7w", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Colonization records include documents from two government agencies that raised money and support for the removal of formerly enslaved people to Liberia. As early as 1691, the Virginia General Assembly began passing laws that forced free Black Virginians to leave the Commonwealth. Fears around insurrection and the desire to control the Black population gave rise to institutions dedicated to removing free people of color from Virginia. \n \nThe General Assembly passed an act in 1833 \"making appropriations for the removal of free persons of color\" to the western coast of Africa and established a board of commissioners charged with carrying out the provisions of the act. \u201cThe Board of Commissioners for the Removal of Free Persons of Color records, 1833-1856,\u201d contain correspondence, lists, minutes, oaths, and resolutions. Included are lists of free Black individuals who emigrated to Liberia (including the name of the ship), lists of free Black individuals willing to emigrate, and resolutions to send money to the American Colonization Society and to those who transported the free Black people to Liberia. Also included is a report of the Board of Commissioners, 1835, containing a list of free Black people transported to Liberia and including their names, ages, and where they had lived in Virginia.\n \nThe General Assembly passed an act on April 6, 1853 to create the Colonization Board of Virginia, (chap. 55, p. 58). This act also created appropriations to fund the voluntary transportation and removal of free Black individuals to Liberia or elsewhere in West Africa through the efforts of the Virginia branch of the American Colonization Society. Statutory members of the board included the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Auditor of Public Accounts, the Second Auditor of Public Accounts, and four other competent members appointed by the Governor. An annual tax was levied on free Black men between the ages of 21 to 55 to help finance the operations of the board. The Colonization Board was authorized to reimburse the agents of the Virginia Colonization Society for transportation costs only after receiving satisfactory proof that the formerly enslaved individuals had been transported out of the state. The Virginia Colonization Society arranged for the actual passage of free Black individuals, and at each meeting the Board received affidavits for particular free people who had already been transported, along with evidence that the individuals were free or born of free parents, that they were residents of Virginia and that they had already been transported to Africa or that they had embarked to another state for transportation. The Board was required to keep a journal of its proceedings, showing all actions taken and monies disbursed, and was also required to submit a biennial report to the General Assembly showing the name, age, sex, and locality of each person removed. The board held its last meeting on August 14, 1858, after the preceding session of the General Assembly failed to extend its existence. The Virginia Board of Colonization journal of proceedings includes lists of the names and ages of free Black individuals transported from the commonwealth to Africa, as well as the county, city, or borough from which they were transported, and in some instances also includes the name of the ship and names of former enslavers.\n\n\nData in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-17T13:42:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-29T14:10:03.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:42:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:42:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["Destination", "Barcode", "Name of Ship", "File Name", "First Name", "Middle Name", "Suffix", "Gender", "Occupation", "Method of Emancipation", "Date Ship Sailed", "Town", "Date Added or Updated", "Date (of entry)", "Surname", "Alias", "Age", "Name of Spouse", "Name of Children", "Name of Parents", "Previous Enslaver", "County/City"], "columns_field_name": ["destination", "barcode", "name_of_ship", "file_name", "first_name", "middle_name", "suffix", "gender", "occupation", "method_of_emancipation", "date_ship_sailed", "town", "date_added", "date_of_entry", "surname", "alias", "age", "name_of_spouse", "name_of_children", "name_of_parents", "previous_enslaver", "county_city"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Destination of the emigrating individual", "Barcode for the box housing the original physical document referenced", "Name of ship emigrating individual traveled on", "File name for the digital version of the document referenced", "First name of the individual emigrating ", "Middle name of the individual emigrating", "Suffix of the individual emigrating", "Recorded gender of the emigrating individual", "Occupation of emigrating individual", "Method of gaining freedom if emigrating individual was formerly enslaved", "Date ship sailed", "Town in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Date that the information was recorded ", "Last name of the individual emigating", "Any aliases or nicknames of the emigrating individual", "Recorded age of the emigrating individual", "Name of emigrating individual's spouse if applicable", "Name of emigrating individual's children if applicable", "Name of emigrating individual's parents", "If applicable, name of previous enslaver of emigrating individual", "County/City in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-21T17:16:17.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "demographics", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["colonization", "emigration", "liberia", "library of virginia", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/t4nd-rm7w", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Colonization-Records/t4nd-rm7w", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error.

The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-17T13:31:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-11-23T15:56:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Added or Updated", "Enslaver's First Name", "Status", "Gender", "Suffix", "Enslaver's Surname", "Surname", "Date", "Age", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Standardized Cause of Death ", "Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "File Name", "First Name", "Source", "Middle Name", "Barcode", "Locality"], "columns_field_name": ["date_added", "owner_first_name", "status", "gender", "suffix", "owner_surname", "surname", "date", "age", "cause_of_death", "cause_of_death_1", "additional_slave_names", "additional_free_black_names", "file_name", "first_name", "source", "middle_name", "barcode", "locality"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "If enslaved, the first name of the enslaver of the deceased individual", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.
