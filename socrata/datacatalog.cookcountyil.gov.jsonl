{"resource": {"name": "Assessor - Residential Condominium Unit Characteristics", "id": "3r7i-mrz4", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Residential condominium unit characteristics collected and maintained by the Assessor's office for all of Cook County, from 1999 to present. The office uses this data primarily for valuation, assessments, and reporting.\n\nWhen working with Parcel Index Numbers (PINs) make sure to zero-pad them to 14 digits. Some datasets may lose leading zeros for PINs when downloaded.\n\nThis data is unit-level. Each 14-digit PIN represents one condominium unit. The first 10 digits of each PIN are the condominium building. Additional notes: <ul><li>The Assessor's Office has historically not tracked any internal, unit-level characteristics for condominiums, including square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. In 2021, the office began to manually compile unit-level data from a variety of sources. The ultimate intention is to gather basic data on all condominium units in the county.</li>\n<li>As such, unit square footage, building total square footage, and unit number of bedrooms are only available on a per-triad basis after 2021. Future data updates will add these features for other areas.</li>\n<li>Condominiums are assessed based on their percentage of ownership. See the link below for more information on how this process works. The percentage of ownership for all units in a building should sum to 1. However, this may not always be the case in this data, since it does not include commercial units.</li>\n<li>Condominium parcels can also be parking areas, storage units, or common areas. Identifying these units can be challenging, and they are not valued using mass appraisal. The Assessor's Office has an ongoing effort to clean up and identify these unit records.</li>\n<li>Current property class codes, their levels of assessment, and descriptions can be found <a href=\"https://prodassets.cookcountyassessor.com/s3fs-public/form_documents/classcode.pdf\">on the Assessor's website</a>. Note that class codes details can change across time.</li>\n<li>Data will be updated bi-weekly.</li>\n<li>Depending on the time of year, some third-party and internal data will be missing for the most recent year. Assessments mailed this year represent values from last year, so this isn't an issue. By the time the Data Department models values for this year, those data will have populated.</li>\n<li>Rowcount and characteristics for a given year are final once the Assessor <a href=\"https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines\">has certified the assessment roll</a> for all townships.</li></ul>For more information on how this data is used to estimate condominium unit values, see the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/models/ccao_condo_avm\">Assessor's condominium modeling code</a> on GitLab.\n\nTownship codes can be found <a href=\"https://prodassets.cookcountyassessor.com/s3fs-public/page_comm/trimap.pdf\">in the legend of this map</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/stories/s/i22y-9sd2\">Read about the Assessor's 2022 Open Data Refresh.</a>", "attribution": "Cook County Assessor's Office", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-01T05:34:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-04-25T17:59:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-01T05:20:30.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-01T05:34:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["cdu", "unit_sf", "tax_year", "proration_rate", "building_pins", "building_sqft", "year_built", "pin_is_multiland", "is_common_area", "land_sqft", "bedrooms", "township_code", "class", "pin10", "pin", "is_parking_space", "bldg_is_mixed_use", "building_non_units", "card_num", "pin_num_landlines"], "columns_field_name": ["cdu", "char_unit_sf", "year", "char_tiebldgpct", "char_building_pins", "char_building_sf", "char_yrblt", "pin_is_multiland", "is_common_area", "char_land_sf", "char_bedrooms", "township_code", "class", "pin10", "pin", "is_parking_space", "bldg_is_mixed_use", "char_building_non_units", "card", "pin_num_landlines"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Condition, Desirability, and Utility code.

Each row in a given year corresponds to a building e.g. two rows for the same parcel in one year means a parcel has more than one building.\n\nData will be updated bi-weekly. Rowcount and characteristics for a given year are final once the Assessor <a href=\"https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines\">has certified the assessment roll</a> for the all townships.\n\nDepending on the time of year, some third-party and internal data will be missing for the most recent year.

By the time the Data Department models values for this year, those data will have populated.\n\nNOTE: The Assessor's Office has recently changed the way Home Improvement Exemptions (HIEs) are tracked in its data. HIEs \"freeze\" a property's characteristics for a period of time with the intention of encouraging owners to improve their property without fear of assessment increases.\n\nHistorically, the updated, \"improved\" characteristics were saved in a separate file.
