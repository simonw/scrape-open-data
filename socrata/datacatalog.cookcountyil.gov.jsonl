We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nSingle and multi-family (less than 7 units) property characteristics collected and maintained by the Assessor's Office for all of Cook County, from 1999 to present.

Note that class codes details can change across time.\n\nThis data is improvement-level - 'improvements' are individual buildings on a parcel. Each row in a given year corresponds to a building e.g. two rows for the same parcel in one year means a parcel has more than one building.\n\nData will be updated bi-weekly. Rowcount and characteristics for a given year are final once the Assessor <a href=\"https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines\">has certified the assessment roll</a> for the all townships.\n\nDepending on the time of year, some third-party and internal data will be missing for the most recent year. Assessments mailed this year represent values from last year, so this isn't an issue. By the time the Data Department models values for this year, those data will have populated.\n\nNOTE: The Assessor's Office has recently changed the way Home Improvement Exemptions (HIEs) are tracked in its data. HIEs \"freeze\" a property's characteristics for a period of time with the intention of encouraging owners to improve their property without fear of assessment increases.\n\nHistorically, the updated, \"improved\" characteristics were saved in a separate file. However, in more recent years, the improved characteristics are saved in the main characteristics file. As such, the records in this data set from before 2021 do NOT include HIE characteristic updates, while those after and including 2021 DO include those updates.\n\nFor more information on HIEs, see the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/ccao-data-science---modeling/-/wikis/Residential/Home%20Improvement%20Exemptions\">Assessor's Data Department wiki</a>.\n\nFor more information on how this data is used to estimate property values, see the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/models/ccao_res_avm\">Assessor's residential modeling code</a> on GitLab.\n\nTownship codes can be found <a href=\"https://prodassets.cookcountyassessor.com/s3fs-public/page_comm/trimap.pdf\">in the legend of this map</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/stories/s/i22y-9sd2\">Read about the Assessor's 2022 Open Data Refresh.</a>", "attribution": "Cook County Assessor's Office", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-16T20:12:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-04-19T11:34:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-16T16:16:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-16T20:12:36.000Z", "columns_name": ["township_code", "pin_num_landlines", "pin_num_cards", "pin_is_multiland", "pin_is_multicard", "year_built", "single_v_multi_family", "type_of_residence", "site_desirability", "num_rooms", "roof_material", "repair_condition", "renovation", "porch", "num_commercial_units", "land_sqft", "central_heating", "num_half_baths", "garage_size", "garage_ext_wall_material", "garage_attached", "garage_area_included", "num_fireplaces", "num_full_baths", "ext_wall_material", "construction_quality", "basement_finish", "basement_type", "num_bedrooms", "attic_type", "attic_finish", "num_apartments", "central_air", "design_plan", "building_sqft", "cdu", "class", "card_num", "tax_year", "pin"], "columns_field_name": ["township_code", "pin_num_landlines", "pin_num_cards", "pin_is_multiland", "pin_is_multicard", "char_yrblt", "char_use", "char_type_resd", "char_site", "char_rooms", "char_roof_cnst", "char_repair_cnd", "char_renovation", "char_porch", "char_ncu", "char_land_sf", "char_heat", "char_hbath", "char_gar1_size", "char_gar1_cnst", "char_gar1_att", "char_gar1_area", "char_frpl", "char_fbath", "char_ext_wall", "char_cnst_qlty", "char_bsmt_fin", "char_bsmt", "char_beds", "char_attic_type", "char_attic_fnsh", "char_apts", "char_air", "char_tp_plan", "char_bldg_sf", "cdu", "class", "card", "year", "pin"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Township code", "Number of landlines on a parcel.
