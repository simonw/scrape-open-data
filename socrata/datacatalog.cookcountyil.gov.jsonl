A post census effort took place in December 2021 to cut the number of precincts down countywide to 1430.\nElection Data Services conducted Phase 2 of the Census Redistricting Data Program for the State of Illinois, as well as implemented changes made post census in Cook County.\n\n\nPrecincts are updated as needed before every election by the Cook County Clerk's Elections Department.", "attribution": "Cook County Clerk", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-10T07:02:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-04-22T17:39:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-10T07:02:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-10T07:02:28.000Z", "columns_name": ["name", "Shape.STArea()", "STATEFP", "Township_Name", "OBJECTID", "GlobalID", "precinctid", "Shape.STLength()", "Township_Number", "Precinct_Number", "last_edited_date", "COUNTYFP", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["name", "shape_starea", "statefp", "township_name", "objectid", "globalid", "precinctid", "shape_stlength", "township_number", "precinct_number", "last_edited_date", "countyfp", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Date", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-22T17:46:52.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "GIS/Maps", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department_Publishing-Department", "value": "Cook County GIS"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "As needed"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "As needed"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-coverage", "value": "Cook County without City of Chicago"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/d/k7sw-w3b8", "link": "https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/GIS-Maps/Suburban-Cook-Election-Precincts-Current/k7sw-w3b8", "owner": {"id": "mngp-xcc5", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "GIS ETL"}, "creator": {"id": "mngp-xcc5", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "GIS ETL"}}
