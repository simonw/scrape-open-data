Each row in a given year corresponds to a building e.g. two rows for the same parcel in one year means a parcel has more than one building.\n\nData will be updated bi-weekly. Rowcount and characteristics for a given year are final once the Assessor <a href=\"https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines\">has certified the assessment roll</a> for the all townships.\n\nDepending on the time of year, some third-party and internal data will be missing for the most recent year.

By the time the Data Department models values for this year, those data will have populated.\n\nNOTE: The Assessor's Office has recently changed the way Home Improvement Exemptions (HIEs) are tracked in its data. HIEs \"freeze\" a property's characteristics for a period of time with the intention of encouraging owners to improve their property without fear of assessment increases.\n\nHistorically, the updated, \"improved\" characteristics were saved in a separate file.
