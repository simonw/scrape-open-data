All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nThe case rate per 100,000 includes probable and confirmed cases. Probable and confirmed are defined using the CSTE case definition, which is available online: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death. More information on COVID-19 mortality can be found at the following link: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Mortality/Mortality-Statistics\n\nData are reported daily, with timestamps indicated in the daily briefings posted at: portal.ct.gov/coronavirus.

The tests included in this dataset include both molecular and antigen datasets. Molecular tests reported include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid amplicfication (NAAT) tests.\n\nA delay in the data pull schedule occurred on 06/23/2020.

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average. The 7-day metrics are no longer being updated as of 10/15/2020 but the archived dataset can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/s22x-83rd\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nAdditional notes:\nAs of 11/5/2020, CT DPH has added antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 to reported test counts in this dataset. The tests included in this dataset include both molecular and antigen datasets. Molecular tests reported include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid amplicfication (NAAT) tests.\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData suppression is applied when the rate is <5 cases per 100,000 or if there are <5 cases within the town.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report information on all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to CT WiZ, the Connecticut Immunization Information System.

Starting on 10/15/2020, the school learning model indicator metrics will be calculated using a 14-day average rather than a 7-day average. The new school learning model indicators dataset using 14-day averages can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CT-School-Learning-Model-Indicators-by-County-14-d/e4bh-ax24\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nThis dataset includes the leading and secondary metrics identified by the Connecticut Department of Health (DPH) and the Department of Education (CSDE) to support local district decision-making on the level of in-person, hybrid (blended), and remote learning model for Pre K-12 education. \n\nData represent daily averages for each week by date of specimen collection (cases and positivity), date of hospital admission, or date of ED visit. Hospitalization data come from the Connecticut Hospital Association and are based on hospital location, not county of patient residence. COVID-19-like illness includes fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or the presence of coronavirus diagnosis code and excludes patients with influenza-like illness. All data are preliminary.\n\nThese data are updated weekly; the previous week period for each dataset is the previous Sunday-Saturday, known as an MMWR week (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). The date listed is the date the dataset was last updated and corresponds to a reporting period of the previous MMWR week.

The survey collects vaccination and exemption status data on children who entered the school system on or before a specified date during the fall semester. Individual vaccine information on each student is not collected.\n\nThis table shows the statewide vaccination exemptions (medical and religious) and percentage vaccinated and compliant for each school-entry mandated vaccine series reported by school year, grade, and school type. Percentage of students vaccinated is the number of students with the required number of doses of a given vaccine divided by the total number of students.  Data for each grade includes all schools who reported with that given grade level.\n\nSchool-mandated vaccine series for students enrolled in kindergarten are inactivated polio, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), hepatitis B, varicella and hepatitis A. Additional mandated vaccines for students enrolled in 7th grade include meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis). Influenza vaccine is a requirement for pre-K students only, who are 24 through 59 months of age.\n\nEach child has 1 of 4 possible vaccination statutes: Vaccinated, Exempt (Religious), Exempt (Medical) or Non-compliant.

Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021.

The survey collects vaccination and exemption status data on children who entered the school system on or before a specified date during the fall semester. Individual vaccine information on each student is not collected. \n\nThis table shows the percentage of seventh grade students vaccinated for each school-entry mandated vaccine series and the percentage with vaccination exemptions (medical or religious) reported by school. Percentage of students vaccinated is the number of students with the required number of doses of a given vaccine divided by the total number of students. Data includes all schools who reported students in seventh grade. \n\nSchool-mandated vaccine series for students enrolled in seventh grade are inactivated polio, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), hepatitis B, varicella, hepatitis A, meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis).\n\nEach child has 1 of 4 possible vaccination statutes: Vaccinated, Exempt (Religious), Exempt (Medical) or Non-compliant. The criteria shown below are used to assess whether a child is considered vaccinated.  \n\n\u2022\tMMR = at least 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022\tVaricella = at least 2 doses of varicella vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday, or a reliable history of chickenpox disease. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022\tHepA = at least 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine, given a minimum of six calendar months apart, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten. Starting with the 2019-2020 school year the annual survey included data collection on hepatitis A vaccine for 7th grade students. \n\u2022\tMCV = at least 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine. This is a school entry requirement starting in 7th grade.\n\u2022\tTdap = at least 1 dose of Tdap vaccine. This is a school entry requirement starting in 7th grade.\n\u2022\tAll = Percentage of students with all above vaccine series required for that grade level.\n\nChildren without a record of vaccination, but with serologic proof of immunity to certain diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and varicella), meet school entry requirements and may be counted as vaccinated.\n\nThe values for schools with fewer than 30 enrolled seventh graders are suppressed, and those fields are left blank.\n\nData Limitations and Considerations:\n\u2022\tThe school level data shown here are as tabulated and reported by schools and discrepancies may exist. \n\u2022\tThe Immunization Program identifies outliers and internally inconsistent data points and works with schools to resolve any data quality issues, when possible. \n\u2022\tCT DPH cannot verify the accuracy of vaccine data for individual children or whether the documentation necessary to claim an exemption has been submitted.\n\u2022\tData are collected at the beginning of the school year, by which time vaccines are due. As the year progresses, immunization rates may increase as additional children receive required immunizations. Additionally, the student body is dynamic and as students arrive and leave school, the immunization rates are impacted. \n\u2022\tVaccine status is assessed on the level of the child and not on each vaccine. Once a child is listed as exempt, vaccination data is no longer collected in the survey for that child.

Starting on 10/15/2020, these metrics will be calculated using a 14-day average rather than a 7-day average. The new dataset using 14-day averages can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/hree-nys2\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nThis dataset includes a weekly count and weekly rate per 100,000 population for COVID-19 cases, a weekly count of COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests, and a weekly percent positivity rate for tests among people living in community settings. Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case. \n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities. \n\nThese data are updated weekly; the previous week period for each dataset is the previous Sunday-Saturday, known as an MMWR week (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). The date listed is the date the dataset was last updated and corresponds to a reporting period of the previous MMWR week.

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a program in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple programs in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary vaccine series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.    \n\nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series. For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed.\n\n SVI refers to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index - a measure that combines 15 demographic variables to identify communities most vulnerable to negative health impacts from disasters and public health crises. Measures of social vulnerability include socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, race, ethnicity, language, and transportation limitations - among others.

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Township Counts - by Type of Assistance (TOA) - CY 2020", "id": "v6t2-ukrq", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nDSS CY 2020 Town counts - Number of people enrolled in DSS services in the calendar year 2020, by township and type of assistance (TOA).\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 1/16/2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\nNOTE: On 1/1/2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a medical benefit plan in that calendar year. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple plans in the same year; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016.

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Township Counts - by Race - CY 2020", "id": "vj9p-2u99", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nDSS CY 2020 Town counts - Number of people enrolled in DSS services in the calendar year 2020, by township and race.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 1/16/2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\nNOTE: On 1/1/2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility", "id": "vvtn-9xef", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The \"COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility\" dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, filtered for Connecticut. View the full dataset and detailed metadata here: https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u\n\nThe following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\nA \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\nhhs_ids\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set has been converted to a corrected data set. The corrections applied to this data set are to smooth out data anomalies caused by keyed in data errors. To help determine which records have had corrections made to it. An additional Boolean field called is_corrected has been added. To see the numbers as reported by the facilities, go to:\nhttps://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/uqq2-txqb\n\nOn May 13, 2021 Changed vaccination fields from sum to max or min fields.

It includes people of all ages.   \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nA person who has received at least one dose of any vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.  \n\nRace and ethnicity data may be self-reported or taken from an existing electronic health care record.   Reported race and ethnicity information is used to create a single race/ethnicity variable. People with Hispanic ethnicity are classified as Hispanic regardless of reported race.  People with a missing ethnicity are classified as non-Hispanic. People with more than one race are classified as multiple race. \n\nA vaccine coverage percentage cannot be calculated for people classified as NH Other race or NH Unknown race since there are not population size estimates for these groups. Data quality assurance activities suggest that NH Other may represent a missing value. Vaccine coverage estimates in specific race/ethnicity groups may be underestimated as result of the exclusion of records classified as NH Unknown Race or NH Other Race.   \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used. \nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census) or potential data reporting errors.\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics).  Changes in the size and composition of the population between 2014 and 2021 may results in inaccuracy in vaccine coverage estimates.  For example, the size of the Hispanic population may be underestimated in a town given the reported increase in the size of the Hispanic population between the 2010 and 2020 censuses resulting in inflated vaccine coverage estimates. \n\nThe 2014 census data are grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators.  \n\nThis table does not included doses administered to CT residents by out-of-state providers or by some Federal entities (including Department of Defense, Department of Correction, Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, Indian Health Service) because they are not yet reported to CT WiZ (the CT immunization Information System).  It is expected that these data will be added in the future. \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated.

Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.\n\nExamples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected. \n\nData limitations and factors to consider when using this data: \nThis data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center. \n\nFor a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .\n\nIf errors are found or there are questions about the data, please contact the program unit using the following email address: DEEP.SpillsDocs@ct.gov", "attribution": "Department of Energy & Environmental Protection", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-14T15:16:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-12-18T21:24:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-14T15:14:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-14T15:16:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Media Info", "Cause Info", "Corrective Actions Taken", "Waterbodies Affected", "Emergency Measures", "Total Quantity Drums", "Total Quantity Feet", "Total Quantity Yards", "Total Quantity Gallons", "Release Substance", "Release Type", "Location Of Reported Release", "Responsible Party Zip", "Responsible Party State", "Responsible Party Town", "Responsible Party Address", "Responsibile Party/Discharger", "Town of Release", "Release date and time", "Date Reported Time Reported", "Assigned to", "Case No.", "Year", "Status", "Type of Waterbody Affected", "Responsible Party Accepts Responsibility (Y/N)", "Representing", "Reported By", "Total Quantity Pounds", "State of Release"], "columns_field_name": ["mediainfo", "causeinfo", "actions", "waterbodiesaffected", "emergencymeasures", "quandrums", "quanfeet", "quanyards", "quangallons", "releasesubstance", "releasetype", "location", "repzip", "repstate", "reptown", "repstreet", "discharger", "townrelease", "releasedatetime", "date_reported_time_reported", "assignedto", "caseno", "year", "status", "waterbody", "responsibility", "representing", "reportedby", "quanlbs", "stateofrelease"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The environmental media or setting affected by the release", "Cause of incident, if known", "Response actions taken to address the release, if known at the time of the incident\u2019s report to CT DEEP  ", "Waterbody name(s) if known or expected to be affected", "Additional information regarding the incident ", "Amount in Drums of substance spilled or found --\u201c0\u201d indicates indicates zero or can indicate an unknown amount.

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured.

Starting in July 2020, this dataset will no longer be updated and will be replaced by the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset, available at the following link: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CMS-COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/w8wc-65i5. \n\nMethods: \n1) Laboratory-confirmed case counts are based upon data reported via the FLIS web portal. Nursing homes were asked to provide cumulative totals of residents with laboratory confirmed covid. This includes residents currently in-house, in the hospital, or who are deceased. Residents were excluded if they tested positive prior to initial admission to the nursing home. \n2) The cumulative number of deaths among nursing home residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).\n \nLimitations:\n1) As of the week of 5/10/20, Point Prevalence Survey testing is being offered to all asymptomatic nursing home residents to inform infection prevention efforts. Point prevalence surveys will be conducted over a period of several weeks. Some nursing homes had adequate testing resources available to conduct surveys prior to this date. Differences in survey timing will impact the number of positive results that a nursing home reports.\n2) Cumulative totals of residents testing positive are being collected rather than individual resident data. Thus we cannot verify the counts, de-duplicate, and/or verify whether there is a record of a positive lab test. This may result in either under- or over-counting.\n3) The number of COVID-19 positive residents and the number of confirmed deaths among residents are tabulated from different data sources. Due to the timing of availability of test results for deceased residents, it is not appropriate to calculate the percent of cases who died due to COVID-19 at any particular facility based upon this data.\n4) The count of deaths reported for 4/14 are not included in this dataset, as they were not broken out by laboratory-confirmed or probable.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment.\n\u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/\n\u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information.\n\u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.\n\nWHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF?\nThe Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal: \n\u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500);\n\u2022 larger display of search returns;\n\u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and\n\u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format)\n\u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images. \nThe main advantages of the Portal are:\n\u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and\n\u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time. \n\nWHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA?\nAll hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including:\n\u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment\n\u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed)\n\u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number)\n\u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator\n\u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018.\n\u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting. \n\nAll other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had  additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nPercentages are calculated using 2019 census data (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-Town-and-County-Population-for-Connecticut).  \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it to a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used, if available. People for whom an address is not currently available are shown in this table as \u201cAddress pending validation\u201d. Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  Also, the percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated when records for an individual cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town.
