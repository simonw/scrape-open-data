To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases, tests, and associated deaths from COVID-19 that have been reported among Connecticut residents. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nThe case rate per 100,000 includes probable and confirmed cases. Probable and confirmed are defined using the CSTE case definition, which is available online: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  CO", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-27T19:30:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T03:13:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-27T19:30:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-24T19:02:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Number of tests", "Confirmed deaths", "Confirmed cases", "Town", "Number of negatives", "Number of positives", "Town number", "Total deaths", "Rate tested per 100k", "Case rate", "Last update date", "Total cases ", "Number of indeterminates", "People tested", "Probable deaths", "Probable cases"], "columns_field_name": ["numberoftests", "townconfirmeddeaths", "townconfirmedcases", "town", "numberofnegatives", "numberofpositives", "town_no", "towntotaldeaths", "ratetested100k", "towncaserate", "lastupdatedate", "towntotalcases", "numberofindeterminates", "peopletested", "townprobabledeaths", "townprobablecases"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Number of molecular COVID-19 tests reported", "Number of confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths", "Number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases", "Town name", "Number of negative tests", "Number of positive tests", "Town number", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Rate of people tested per 100,000", "Rate of cases per 100,000", "Date dataset was last updated", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases", "Number of indeterminate tests", "Number of people tested", "Number of probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Number of probable COVID-19 cases"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-01T19:43:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "public safety", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid archive"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Agency_Geographic-Unit", "value": "City"}, {"key": "Agency_Update-Frequency", "value": "Every weekday"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Topic", "value": "Tests, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Geography", "value": "Town"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Temporal-coverage", "value": "Cumulative"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Community-vs.-congregate-setting", "value": "Community and congregate settings"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/28fr-iqnx", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Tests-Cases-and-Deaths-By-Town-ARCHIVE/28fr-iqnx", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average. The 7-day metrics are no longer being updated as of 10/15/2020 but the archived dataset can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/s22x-83rd\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report information on all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to CT WiZ, the Connecticut Immunization Information System.
