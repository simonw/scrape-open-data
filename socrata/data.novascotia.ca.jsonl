For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument.

CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Antigonish-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average/d6fb-k8yz).   Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).

Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Annapolis-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/a3qb-nf5k). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Shelburne-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/5ech-4c5t). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

Some case investigations in recent years remain ongoing. NS totals may be greater than sum of zones, as totals include cases from out of province and a small proportion where location of residence is under investigation.  Data include NSMES cases for which manner of death was determined to be suicide and recorded as suicide on the Medical Certificate of Death by the Medical Examiner.   Data for recent months and for the previous year are preliminary and counts and associated rates are likely to increase as case investigations are completed. Case review found that >90% of suicide deaths excluding those caused by drug toxicity were certified post-autopsy, which occurs within days of a reported death. Acccordingly, monitoring of suicide excluding drug toxicity provides a largely accurate, timely indicator of non-drug toxicity suicide. As such, counts of deaths by suicide excluding drug toxicity deaths is provided in addition to counts of total suicide deaths. Indicators of probable and confirmed drug toxicity deaths (including accident and suicide deaths) are also available on the data.novascotia.ca site for concurrent monitoring.  Data provided here may differ from Vital Statistics data sources due to differences in reporting timeframes (e.g. a death certified as suicide may appear under the 'not elsewhere classified' classification if the death was not certified by the time of data submission for a particular report.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Queens-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-Val/twbe-dv9i). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).

These characteristics should be taken into consideration when comparing or otherwise analyzing data from this database.

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Shelburne_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.  Each individual row of data (Ensemble) presents speed and direction measurements for each measurement cell that have been averaged from multiple individual measurements (Pings) over a specified time period (Averaging Interval).  The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements), the Averaging Interval and the Number of Pings averaged can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment.

Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. Note that some observations of 0m wave height may reflect false zero recordings, and analyses should be conducted accordingly. Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the ADCPs presents wave height (significant, maximum, height average of the top 1/3 & 1/10 largest waves) measured in metres, and period (peak, maximum, period average of the top 1/3 & 1/10 largest waves) measured in seconds. Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates. The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements) can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment.

For the writing portion of the assessment, students completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Richmond-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-V/5p9y-iyag). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

True old growth forests are uncommon, and make up only a small proportion of the stands in this layer.

Prior to 2019, samples were collected at the following five sites: St Mary's River at Stillwater, Shelburne River at Pollard's Falls Bridge, Northeast Margaree River at Margaree Valley, Kelley River at Eight Mile Ford and LaHave River at West Northfield. The samples are submitted to the Nova Scotia Environmental Services Laboratory operated by the Nova Scotia Health Authority in Halifax, NS for analysis. Field parameters are measured using a Hydrolab multi-parameter probe. The following are the monitored water quality parameters and applicable measurement units: field temperature (\u00b0C), field pH (-), field conductivity (mmhos/cm), field dissolved oxygen (mg/L), field turbidity (NTU), select metals (\u00b5g/L), calcium (mg/L), magnesium (mg/L), hardness as CaCO3 (mg/L), lab conductivity (umho/cm), lab pH (-), lab turbidity (NTU), alkalinity as CaCO3 (mg/L), chloride (mg/L), colour (TCU), silica (mg/L), sulphate (mg/L), total nitrogen (mg/L), nitrate and nitrite as N (mg/L), ammonia as N (mg/L), orthophosphorus as P, (mg/L), total phosphorus (mg/L), total suspended solids (mg/L), total organic carbon (mg/L), chlorophyll a (mg/m3) and pheophytin (\u00b5g/L).  In 2019, additional metals and dissolved organic carbon (mg/L) were added to the lab parameter list.  Seven of the stations are located on watercourses and are co-located with Water Survey of Canada hydrometric stations.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects temperature (degrees Celsius), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), and intermittent salinity (practical salinity units) data using autonomous sensors attached to moored lines, called \u2018sensor strings\u2019. Each string is attached to the seafloor by an anchored acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the sensor. Data are retrieved by triggering the acoustic release, enabling the sensor string to float to the surface for data download. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes.   The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. We recommend using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Data-Digby-County-Daily/yeii-vbir).   Coastal Monitoring Program data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Coastal Monitoring Program: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).

Note that some observations of 0m wave height may reflect false zero recordings, and analyses should be conducted accordingly.

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates. The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements) can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Halifax-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-Va/vpt7-apvp). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Victoria_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.
