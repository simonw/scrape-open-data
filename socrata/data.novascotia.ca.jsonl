Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Victoria_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.
