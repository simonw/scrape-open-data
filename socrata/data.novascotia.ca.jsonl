Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Pictou_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.

CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Guysborough-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Averag/gvmv-b2s3).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Lunenburg-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/xg2s-uhbg).   Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Lunenburg_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.  Each individual row of data (Ensemble) presents speed and direction measurements for each measurement cell that have been averaged from multiple individual measurements (Pings) over a specified time period (Averaging Interval).

The attached 20210315_Inverness_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details contains a summary of deployment specifications related to individual data sets within this database. Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Inverness_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.  Each individual row of data (Ensemble) presents speed and direction measurements for each measurement cell that have been averaged from multiple individual measurements (Pings) over a specified time period (Averaging Interval).  The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements), the Averaging Interval and the Number of Pings averaged can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment.  Because these data are collected in vertical profile at locations of varying depths and tidal ranges, most d"}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Time-Period-Coverage", "value": "2015-2019"}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Frequency", "value": "As needed"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.novascotia.ca", "license": "Nova Scotia Open Government Licence"}, "permalink": "https://data.novascotia.ca/d/fu6s-y58d", "link": "https://data.novascotia.ca/Fishing-and-Aquaculture/Inverness-County-Current-Speed-and-Direction-Data/fu6s-y58d", "owner": {"id": "9pyy-md4w", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data Nova Scotia"}, "creator": {"id": "9pyy-md4w", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data Nova Scotia"}}

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Colchester-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average/cx5r-jnfx). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates.

Effective period dates can vary according to collective agreements currently in effect. Most classification effective dates run from April 1 - March 31, however CUPE effective dates run from November 1 - October 31. As contracts are negotiated, pay scales can change, even retroactively. This dataset is re-loaded annually, and may not contain new or retroactive changes resulting from negotiations until the next annual refresh. Refer to published Collective Agreements in these cases.  b) Pay Plan Type is either Excluded (Non-Union) or Bargaining Unit (Union) c) If Pay Plan Level is blank, there are no Pay Plan Levels for the specified Pay Plan d) For a specified Pay Plan and/or Level, there will only be a Bi-weekly or Hourly Pay Rate, not both (one will be blank) e) If you try to expand Hourly Pay Rates to Bi-weekly Amounts or Hourly/Bi-weekly Pay Rates to Annual Amounts, they will be estimates only (factors such as varying work hours and the number of annual pay periods will vary from year to year).

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates.

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Digby_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Queens_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.

CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Antigonish-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average/d6fb-k8yz).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Annapolis-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/a3qb-nf5k). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).

These characteristics should be taken into consideration when comparing or otherwise analyzing data from this database.

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Annapolis_County_Current_Speed_and Direction_Data.  Each individual row of data (Ensemble) presents speed and direction measurements for each measurement cell that have been averaged from multiple individual measurements (Pings) over a specified time period (Averaging Interval).  The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements), the Averaging Interval and the Number of Pings averaged can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Shelburne-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/5ech-4c5t). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Queens-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-Val/twbe-dv9i).

Each instrument deployment is assigned a unique ID which can be used to filter and separate individual data sets for export from the Open Data Portal.   Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Shelburne_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.  Each individual row of data (Ensemble) presents speed and direction measurements for each measurement cell that have been averaged from multiple individual measurements (Pings) over a specified time period (Averaging Interval).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Richmond-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-V/5p9y-iyag). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects temperature (degrees Celsius), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), and intermittent salinity (practical salinity units) data using autonomous sensors attached to moored lines, called \u2018sensor strings\u2019. Each string is attached to the seafloor by an anchored acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the sensor. Data are retrieved by triggering the acoustic release, enabling the sensor string to float to the surface for data download. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes.   The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. We recommend using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Data-Digby-County-Daily/yeii-vbir).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Halifax-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-Va/vpt7-apvp). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).

Data collected using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) consist of time-series measurements of ocean current speed and direction collected in vertical profile through the water column and divided into measurement cells of specified size.  These readings are arranged from top to bottom in chronological order and from left to right in order of cell distances from the face of the instrument. For example: the column WaterSpeed_1 contains data collected in the cell nearest to the instrument. The exact location of individual cells within the water column is a function of the altitude of the instrument above the sea floor, the specified size of the individual cells and the blanking distance of the instrument in its current configuration.  These attributes for a given dataset can be found in the attached 20210315_Victoria_County_Current_Data_Deployment_Details.
