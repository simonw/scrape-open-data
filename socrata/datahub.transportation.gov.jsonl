The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
