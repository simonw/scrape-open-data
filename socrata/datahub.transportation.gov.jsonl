MMITSS is a next-generation traffic signal system that seeks to provide a comprehensive traffic information framework to service all modes of transportation.\n\nA BSM is one of the messages belonging to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2735 Standard. This standard is geared toward supporting the interoperability of DSRC applications through the use of a standardized message set and its data frames and data elements. A BSM, which is at times referred to as a \u201cheartbeat\u201d message, is a frequently transmitted message (usually at approximately 10Hz) that is meant to increase a vehicle\u2019s situational awareness. These messages are intended to be used for a variety of applications to exchange safety data regarding a vehicle\u2019s state. \n\n\tA typical BSM contains up to two parts. Part I, the binary large object (blob), is included in every BSM. It contains the fundamental data elements that describe a vehicle\u2019s position (latitude, longitude, elevation) and motion (heading, speed, acceleration). Part II of a BSM contains optional data that is transmitted when required or in response to an event. Typically Part II contains data that serves as an extension of vehicle safety information (path history, path prediction, event flags) and data pertaining to the status of a vehicle\u2019s components, such as lights, wipers, and brakes. \n\nNOTE: All extra attachments are located in Multi-Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal Systems Basic Safety Messages such as MAP, Detectors, and Simulation results", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) --- Recommended citation: \"MMITSS Prototype Development and Impacts Assessment Team.

It does not equate directly to pass/fail as do the other tests. Sensor Range Test. The sensor range test detects readings that fall outside the range of sensor hardware specifications or theoretical limits (i.e., a maximum and minimum value). If the observation value is greater than or equal to the minimum, and less than or equal to the maximum, the sensor reading passes this quality check.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"P\" - The observation passed the quality check.\n\"N\" - The observation did not pass the quality check.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the flag for a quality check for each data record. The SourceId field determines which quality check is depicted in this field. \nFor SourceId = 1, this field depicts the Like Instrument Test. This test verifies that observations from similar sensors on the same platform are within tolerance to each other.\nFor SourceId = 2, this field depicts the Persistence Test which detects whether sensor readings remain constant for a predefined period of time, which varies depending on the observation type. Consecutive sensor readings from the same sensor over the defined period preceding the current observation time are obtained. If one or more of the consecutive sensor values are different, the current sensor reading passes the persistence quality check. If all consecutive sensor values over the given time period are equivalent, the current sensor does not pass the persistence quality check.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the flag for a quality check for each data record.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
