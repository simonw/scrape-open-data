The test site included approximately 14 intersections around Detroit\u2019s COBO convention center and involved 9 equipped vehicles. Traveler Situation Data (TSD) was obtained from the data warehouse, and not the data clearinghouse. Only 19 messages were obtained from our query as the current mode of operation of the Test Bed is that the warehouse only contains a few static messages, which are meant to serve as a proxy for future operation in which query submissions will only return message(s) relevant to the context in which the query was submitted. The messages that returned per a query submission communicates a pertinent advisor message which is in part contextualized by location and content.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All Extra Files are attached in 2014 ITS World Congress Connected Vehicle Test Bed Demonstration Vehicle Situation Data", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) -- Recommended citation: \"South East Michigan Test Bed Contractor Team, Noblis\u2019 Queue Length Algorithm Development Team, and Data Capture and Management Data Sets Contractor Team.

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "attribution": "Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs", "attribution_link": "https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "contact_email": "Randall.Keizer@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-04-21T19:31:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T18:47:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-04-21T19:31:30.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-04-21T19:31:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["tbl", "Geocoded_City2 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (state)", "Geocoded_City1", "nsmiles", "carrier_low", "fare_low", "Geocoded_City1 (address)", "Geocoded_City1 (state)", "Geocoded_City2", "tbl1apk", "Year", "citymarketid_1", "citymarketid_2", "city1", "city2", "airportid_1", "airportid_2", "airport_1", "passengers", "fare", "carrier_lg", "large_ms", "fare_lg", "lf_ms", "Geocoded_City2 (city)", "Geocoded_City1 (city)", "quarter", "Geocoded_City1 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (address)", "airport_2"], "columns_field_name": ["tbl", "location_2_zip", "location_2_state", "location_1", "nsmiles", "carrier_low", "fare_low", "location_1_address", "location_1_state", "location_2", "tbl1apk", "year", "citymarketid_1", "citymarketid_2", "city1", "city2", "airportid_1", "airportid_2", "airport_1", "passengers", "fare", "carrier_lg", "large_ms", "fare_lg", "lf_ms", "location_2_city", "location_1_city", "quarter", "location_1_zip", "location_2_address", "airport_2"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Name of data table", "", "", "Geocoded - City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "Non-Stop market miles (using radian measure)", "Carrier with the lowest fare", "Average fare for the lowest carrier", "", "", "Geocoded - City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "Primary Key for Table 1a,  Unique ID", "Year", "City market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a city market.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
