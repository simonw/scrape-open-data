Where there are more than 5 observations within a 69-mile radius and 5-minute observation time, the IQR is used as a more robust method for spatial quality check. In the instance where there are fewer observations than required for an IQR, the Barnes Spatial quality check is used instead. If the observation type is for atmospheric pressure, the observation is adjusted for sea level for comparison.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"P\" - The observation passed the quality check.\n\"N\" - The observation did not pass the quality check.\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n"], "columns_format": [{"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"view": "address_coords", "align": "left"}, {"view": "date_time", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-11-14T22:33:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "economy", "social services"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Automobiles", "domain_tags": ["arterial", "basic safety message (bsm)", "belle isle park", "connected vehicle data", "connected vehicles", "environment sensor stations", "fhwa road weather management program", "integrated mobile observation", "integrated mobile observation (imo)", "intelligent transportation systems (its)", "its joint program office (jpo)", "its world congress", "michigan", "michigan department of transportation (mdot)", "motorist advisories and warnings", "road weather demonstration", "sensor data", "simulated road weather", "vehicle data translator", "weather"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "Gene.McHale@dot.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "2015-05-07"}, {"key": "Common-Core_License", "value": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "021:013"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2014-09-05/2014-09-11"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Is-Quality-Data", "value": "True"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "Belle Isle, Detroit, Michigan,"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "USDOT"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "irregular"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "021:15"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2015-05-07"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Gene McHale"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "datahub.transportation.gov", "license": "Creative Commons Attribution | Noncommercial | Share Alike 3.0 Unported"}, "permalink": "https://datahub.transportation.gov/d/jc5e-psbx", "link": "https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Road-Weather-Demonstration-Data/jc5e-psbx", "owner": {"id": "6iy3-3vyr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "kathythompson"}, "creator": {"id": "6iy3-3vyr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "kathythompson"}}

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
