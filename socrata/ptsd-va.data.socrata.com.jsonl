Detailed information about the specific coding strategy is available in Comparative Effectiveness Review [CER] No. 207, Psychological and Pharmacological Treatments for Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. (See our \"Risk of Bias\" data story.) \n\nMost domains were rated as Yes (i.e., minimal risk of bias), No (i.e., high risk of bias) or Unclear (i.e., bias could not be determined). The overall study rating is based on the domains and is coded as low, medium or high risk of bias. The 4 domains that were included as components of the overall rating include: Selection bias--randomization adequate, allocation concealment adequate, groups similar at baseline and whether they used intention to treat analyses; Performance bias--care providers masked and patients masked; Detection bias--outcome assessors masked; Attrition bias--overall attrition less than or equal to 20% vs over 20%; differential attrition less than or equal to 15% vs over 15%.\n\nAdditional items assessed (but not considered as part of the overall rating) include: Reporting bias--all prespecified outcomes reported; Reporting bias--method for handling dropouts; Outcome measures equal valid and reliable; Study reports adequate treatment fidelity based on measurements by independent raters.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ncptsd@va.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-18T19:03:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-08-12T00:59:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Risk of Bias Rating", "Study Reports Adequate Treatment Fidelity Based on Measurements by Independent Raters", "Outcome Measures Equal Valid and Reliable", "Reporting Bias: Detail of Other Methods of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: Method of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: All Prespecified Outcomes Reported", "Additional Quantitative Data Reported", "Attrition Differential Greater Than 15%", "Attrition Differential Less Than or Equal to 15%", "Attrition Overall Greater Than 20%", "Attrition Overall Less Than or Equal to 20%", "Selection Bias: ITT Analysis", "Selection Bias: Groups Similar at Baseline", "Selection Bias: Allocation Concealment Adequate", "Selection Bias: Randomization Adequate", "Total N Randomized (Study level)", "Treatment Focus", "Study Class", "Study ID", "Female Percent (Study level)", "Citation", "Detection Bias: Outcome Assessors Masked", "Performance Bias: Patients Masked", "Performance Bias: Care Providers Masked", "PTSDPubs ID", "Trauma Detail (Study level)", "Trauma Type (Study level)", "Male Percent (Study level)", "Female Percent Detail (Study level)", "Year Added to PTSD-Repository", "Community Percent (Study level)", "Veteran Percent (Study level)", "Active Duty Military (Study level)", "Military Status (Study level)", "EPC Assessing Risk of Bias"], "columns_field_name": ["risk_of_bias_rating", "study_reports_adequate", "outcome_measures_equal_valid", "reporting_bias_detail_of", "reporting_bias_method_of", "reporting_bias_all", "additional_quantitative_data", "attrition_differential_greater", "attrition_differential_less", "attrition_overall_greater", "attrition_overall_less_than", "selection_bias_itt_analysis", "selection_bias_groups_similar", "selection_bias_allocation", "selection_bias_randomization", "total_n_randomized", "treatment_focus", "study_class", "study_id", "female_percent", "citation", "detection_bias_outcome", "performance_bias_patients", "performance_bias_care", "ptsdpubs_id", "trauma_detail", "trauma_type", "male_percent", "female_percent_detail", "year_added_to_ptsd_repository", "community", "veteran", "active_duty_military", "military_status", "epc_assessing_risk_of_bias"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Risk of Bias Rating, one of Low, Medium, or High ", "Did study report adequate treatment fidelity based on measurement by independent raters?", "Were outcome measures equal, valid, and reliable?", "Details for \"Other\" methods of handling dropouts", "Method of handling dropouts", "Were all prespecified outcomes reported?", "Describes any additional quantitative data reported but not included in this dataset, including additional definitions of variables like attrition.
