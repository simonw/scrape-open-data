(See our \"Risk of Bias\" data story.) \n\nMost domains were rated as Yes (i.e., minimal risk of bias), No (i.e., high risk of bias) or Unclear (i.e., bias could not be determined). The overall study rating is based on the domains and is coded as low, medium or high risk of bias. The 4 domains that were included as components of the overall rating include: Selection bias--randomization adequate, allocation concealment adequate, groups similar at baseline and whether they used intention to treat analyses; Performance bias--care providers masked and patients masked; Detection bias--outcome assessors masked; Attrition bias--overall attrition less than or equal to 20% vs over 20%; differential attrition less than or equal to 15% vs over 15%.\n\nAdditional items assessed (but not considered as part of the overall rating) include: Reporting bias--all prespecified outcomes reported; Reporting bias--method for handling dropouts; Outcome measures equal valid and reliable; Study reports adequate treatment fidelity based on measurements by independent raters.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ncptsd@va.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-18T19:03:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-08-12T00:59:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Veteran Percent (Study level)", "Community Percent (Study level)", "Female Percent (Study level)", "Female Percent Detail (Study level)", "Male Percent (Study level)", "Trauma Type (Study level)", "Trauma Detail (Study level)", "Study Reports Adequate Treatment Fidelity Based on Measurements by Independent Raters", "Outcome Measures Equal Valid and Reliable", "Reporting Bias: Detail of Other Methods of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: Method of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: All Prespecified Outcomes Reported", "Additional Quantitative Data Reported", "Attrition Differential Greater Than 15%", "Attrition Differential Less Than or Equal to 15%", "Attrition Overall Greater Than 20%", "Attrition Overall Less Than or Equal to 20%", "Detection Bias: Outcome Assessors Masked", "Performance Bias: Patients Masked", "Performance Bias: Care Providers Masked", "Selection Bias: ITT Analysis", "Selection Bias: Groups Similar at Baseline", "Selection Bias: Allocation Concealment Adequate", "Selection Bias: Randomization Adequate", "Total N Randomized (Study level)", "Treatment Focus", "Study ID", "Risk of Bias Rating", "PTSDPubs ID", "Study Class", "Year Added to PTSD-Repository", "Citation", "EPC Assessing Risk of Bias", "Military Status (Study level)", "Active Duty Military (Study level)"], "columns_field_name": ["veteran", "community", "female_percent", "female_percent_detail", "male_percent", "trauma_type", "trauma_detail", "study_reports_adequate", "outcome_measures_equal_valid", "reporting_bias_detail_of", "reporting_bias_method_of", "reporting_bias_all", "additional_quantitative_data", "attrition_differential_greater", "attrition_differential_less", "attrition_overall_greater", "attrition_overall_less_than", "detection_bias_outcome", "performance_bias_patients", "performance_bias_care", "selection_bias_itt_analysis", "selection_bias_groups_similar", "selection_bias_allocation", "selection_bias_randomization", "total_n_randomized", "treatment_focus", "study_id", "risk_of_bias_rating", "ptsdpubs_id", "study_class", "year_added_to_ptsd_repository", "citation", "epc_assessing_risk_of_bias", "military_status", "active_duty_military"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["At the study level, percent of participants who are veterans of armed forces (U.S. or foreign).
