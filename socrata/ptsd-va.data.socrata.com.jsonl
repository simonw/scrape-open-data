Detailed information about the specific coding strategy is available in Comparative Effectiveness Review [CER] No. 207, Psychological and Pharmacological Treatments for Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. (See our \"Risk of Bias\" data story.) \n\nMost domains were rated as Yes (i.e., minimal risk of bias), No (i.e., high risk of bias) or Unclear (i.e., bias could not be determined). The overall study rating is based on the domains and is coded as low, medium or high risk of bias. The 4 domains that were included as components of the overall rating include: Selection bias--randomization adequate, allocation concealment adequate, groups similar at baseline and whether they used intention to treat analyses; Performance bias--care providers masked and patients masked; Detection bias--outcome assessors masked; Attrition bias--overall attrition less than or equal to 20% vs over 20%; differential attrition less than or equal to 15% vs over 15%.\n\nAdditional items assessed (but not considered as part of the overall rating) include: Reporting bias--all prespecified outcomes reported; Reporting bias--method for handling dropouts; Outcome measures equal valid and reliable; Study reports adequate treatment fidelity based on measurements by independent raters.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ncptsd@va.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-18T19:03:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-08-12T00:59:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Detection Bias: Outcome Assessors Masked", "Performance Bias: Patients Masked", "Performance Bias: Care Providers Masked", "Selection Bias: ITT Analysis", "Selection Bias: Groups Similar at Baseline", "Selection Bias: Allocation Concealment Adequate", "Selection Bias: Randomization Adequate", "Total N Randomized (Study level)", "Treatment Focus", "PTSDPubs ID", "Trauma Detail (Study level)", "Trauma Type (Study level)", "Study Class", "Study ID", "Year Added to PTSD-Repository", "Citation", "Reporting Bias: Detail of Other Methods of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: Method of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: All Prespecified Outcomes Reported", "Additional Quantitative Data Reported", "Attrition Differential Greater Than 15%", "Attrition Differential Less Than or Equal to 15%", "Male Percent (Study level)", "Female Percent Detail (Study level)", "Female Percent (Study level)", "Community Percent (Study level)", "Veteran Percent (Study level)", "Active Duty Military (Study level)", "EPC Assessing Risk of Bias", "Military Status (Study level)", "Risk of Bias Rating", "Study Reports Adequate Treatment Fidelity Based on Measurements by Independent Raters", "Outcome Measures Equal Valid and Reliable", "Attrition Overall Greater Than 20%", "Attrition Overall Less Than or Equal to 20%"], "columns_field_name": ["detection_bias_outcome", "performance_bias_patients", "performance_bias_care", "selection_bias_itt_analysis", "selection_bias_groups_similar", "selection_bias_allocation", "selection_bias_randomization", "total_n_randomized", "treatment_focus", "ptsdpubs_id", "trauma_detail", "trauma_type", "study_class", "study_id", "year_added_to_ptsd_repository", "citation", "reporting_bias_detail_of", "reporting_bias_method_of", "reporting_bias_all", "additional_quantitative_data", "attrition_differential_greater", "attrition_differential_less", "male_percent", "female_percent_detail", "female_percent", "community", "veteran", "active_duty_military", "epc_assessing_risk_of_bias", "military_status", "risk_of_bias_rating", "study_reports_adequate", "outcome_measures_equal_valid", "attrition_overall_greater", "attrition_overall_less_than"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Were outcome assessors masked?", "Were patients masked?", "Were care providers masked?", "Did the study use intention-to-treat analysis?", "Were groups similar at baseline?", "Was allocation concealment adeuate?", "Was the randomization adequate?", "Total participants randomized in the study (total of all arms)", "At the study level, one of PTSD or PTSD+SUD", "PTSDPubs identifier", "At the study level, expands on trauma types for studies with the value \"Mixed\" under Trauma Type", "At the study level: Military Sexual Trauma (MST); Combat-related; Child physical abuse; Child sexual abuse; Child other abuse; Rape/sexual assault; Intimate partner violence; Accidents; Illness/medical procedure; Community/school violence; Natural or manmade disasters; Terrorism/political violence/forced displacement; Other; Mixed (If Mixed, list included types; if Other, list short description).
