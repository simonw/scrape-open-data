The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. \r\n\r\nThe QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers. \r\n\r\nData from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California\u2019s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis.

The data is representative of those claims that were processed during the month and does not necessarily represent the month the final payment was made in.  For example, if a claimant is entitled to benefits for the week-ending October 31, 2009, the claim might not get processed until early November and that count would display in the November data.

Due to the complexity of the extended benefits legislation, a claimant could have exhausted an EUC Tier IV claim and still be eligible for FED-ED benefits, or vice versa.  Therefore, to capture any claimants that have exhausted all available benefits a query is run to look for those claimants who have exhausted EUC Tier IV and
