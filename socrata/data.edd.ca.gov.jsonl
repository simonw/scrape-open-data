The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. \r\n\r\nThe QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers. \r\n\r\nData from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California\u2019s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis.

The data is representative of those claims that were processed during the month and does not necessarily represent the month the final payment was made in.  For example, if a claimant is entitled to benefits for the week-ending October 31, 2009, the claim might not get processed until early November and that count would display in the November data.  There are a small percentage of claimants that could go back onto a training extension even after exhausting their FED-ED claim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2219 The data by county represents the mailing address given by the claimant at the time of filing for UI.\u00a0 It is possible that an individual can reside in a different county than their mailing address.\u00a0 Also, this information does not represent the county where the individual worked.\u00a0 It is also possible that a claimant could have moved or changed their mailing address after filing for UI, which would not be reflected here. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2219 Data for claimants residing outside of California but collecting benefits are not included in these figures nor are invalid addresses in California where a county cannot be determined.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2219 California began paying FED-ED benefits in May 2009, with payments retroactive to February 2009 and began paying EUC Tier IV benefits in February 2010, with payments retroactive to December 2009.  Currently, FED-ED or EUC Tier IV are the last extended benefit programs available to claimants.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2219 Claimants who had a FED-ED extension filed with an effective date of November 22, 2009, or before, will continue to be paid FED-ED extended benefits until they exhaust those FED-ED extensions, before filing for the additional EUC Tiers (which includes EUC Tier IV).  Due to the complexity of the extended benefits legislation, a claimant could have exhausted an EUC Tier IV claim and still be eligible for FED-ED benefits, or vice versa.  Therefore, to capture any claimants that have exhausted all available benefits a query is run to look for those claimants who have exhausted EUC Tier IV and
