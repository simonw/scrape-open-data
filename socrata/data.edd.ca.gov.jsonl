A \"New Claim\" is the first claim for a benefit year period, which is 12 months.\u00a0 An individual would only have one new claim during a benefit year period.  Additional Claim is when another claim is filed during the same benefit year and there is intervening work between the current claim and the previous claim.\u00a0 For example, an individual files a new claim, goes back to work, gets laid off and files another claim before the benefit year period of the first claim expires.\u00a0 An individual can have multiple additional claims during the same benefit year if they meet eligibility requirements.
