Zoning for cities is not included in this dataset. Zones are adopted by ordinances with specific technicalities for each community. Land Use designations offer a broad spectrum of allowable uses within a community. It is used to create a Comprehensive Plan Map or used for a Generalized Proposed Land Use Map or GPLUM. This dataset is also used to create the Land Use Designations theme, which covers proposed zoning use. The meaning of proposed is that the property might not be currently used for the purpose stated. It should be noted that Council adopted amendments to land use designations/zoning that will be effective at the beginning of 2006. Also, the Council is in the process of adopting the Mid-County Community Plan which amends land use designations/zoning as well. The Cities polygons found in the zoning data does not necessarily match the current cities boundaries. This is because the zoning data is updated once a year per the \"Pierce County Comprehensive Plan\" and does not allow for changes to be made during the year. The Comprehensive Plan is generally updated in November and generally becomes effective the following March. Use the \"Cities in Pierce County\" data set to determine current city boundaries. City boundaries can change more often than the current adopted Pierce County Zoning data. The zoning data contains the \"Cities in Pierce County\" boundaries at the time that the Pierce County Zoning was adopted. When determining the current zoning of a parcel near a city, the current \"Cities in Pierce County\" data set needs to be reviewed. Zoning codes for parcels within incorporated cities are determined by the city that the parcel is within.

This is due to the presents of levees that affect flooding but are not certified or accredited to protect areas behind them from the 1% Annual Chance Flood per 44 CFR 65.10. While FEMA develops a new engineering and mapping standard for these levees no new adoption of flood risk hazards will occur in the secluded areas.

The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual- chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system.

Also utilized were a combination of orthophotography for both current and historical uses, 2-foot contours (created by the 2011 LIDAR), Department of Natural Resources stream centerlines, adjacent county stream centerlines, and GPS drainage inventory. Each of the sources served a different purpose and combined created more accurate hydrology data for mapping and analysis. All streams manually created. The determination of stream location relied heavily on the 2011 LIDAR and contours while at 1:600 scale or better.
