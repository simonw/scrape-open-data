{"resource": {"name": "United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time", "id": "9mfq-cb36", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "CDC reports aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases and death numbers daily online. Data on the COVID-19 website and CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker are based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. This data set of \u201cUnited States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time\u201d combines this information. However, data are dependent on jurisdictions\u2019 timely and accurate reporting. \n\nSeparately, CDC also regularly reports provisional death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) on data.cdc.gov. Details are described on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS website</a>. Reporting the number of deaths by using death certificates ultimately provides more complete information but is a longer process; therefore, these numbers will be less than the death counts on the COVID-19 website.\n\n<b>Accuracy of Data</b><br/>\nCDC tracks COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths to track trends, detect outbreaks, and monitor whether public health measures are working. However, counting exact numbers of COVID-19 cases is not possible. COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases.\n\nCOVID-19 is one of about <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/\">120 diseases or conditions</a> health departments voluntarily report to CDC. State, local, and territorial public health departments verify and report cases to CDC. When there are differences between numbers of cases reported by CDC versus by health departments, data reported by health departments should be considered the most up to date. Health departments may update case data over time when they receive more complete and accurate information. The number of new cases reported each day fluctuates. There is generally less reporting on the weekends and holidays.\n\nCDC reports death data on three other sections of the website: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">U.S. Cases</a> & Deaths, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html\">COVID Data Tracker</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts</a>. The U.S. Cases and Deaths webpages and COVID Data Tracker get their information from the same source (total case counts); however, NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Because not all jurisdictions report counts daily, counts may increase at different intervals.\n\n<b>Confirmed & Probable Counts</b><br/>\nAs of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\">interim COVID-19 position statement</a> issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease. Nationally notifiable disease cases are voluntarily reported to CDC by jurisdictions.

These data will be updated monthly. Please note that these provisional data are subject to change.\n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a  respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine.  Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\n\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster\n\ndoses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group. \n\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. \n\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, Seattle King County (Washington), South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction.

This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.\n- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>\n- Datasets are created using CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy. \n<br>\n- For more information about data collection and reporting, please see\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.</a><br>\n- For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br>\n\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes patient-level data reported by U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as \"immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\" by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.\nFor more information, visit: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely", "attribution": "CDC Data, Analytics and Visualization Task Force", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-10T04:58:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T16:17:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-10T04:58:30.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-09T19:22:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["current_status", "case_positive_specimen_interval", "hosp_yn", "death_yn", "age_group", "ethnicity", "process", "exposure_yn", "county_fips_code", "underlying_conditions_yn", "race", "case_onset_interval", "icu_yn", "state_fips_code", "sex", "case_month", "res_state", "res_county", "symptom_status"], "columns_field_name": ["current_status", "case_positive_specimen", "hosp_yn", "death_yn", "age_group", "ethnicity", "process", "exposure_yn", "county_fips_code", "underlying_conditions_yn", "race", "case_onset_interval", "icu_yn", "state_fips_code", "sex", "case_month", "res_state", "res_county", "symptom_status"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["What is the current status of this person?

Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals. \nSee https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html for more information. \n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Note:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.

This dataset contains reported daily transmission level at the county level and contains the same values used to display transmission maps on the  <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view\">COVID Data Tracker</a>. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\nCurrently, CDC provides the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the levels as originally posted (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb\">Originally Posted dataset</a>), updated daily with the most recent day\u2019s data, and an historical dataset with the county-level transmission data from January 1, 2021 (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">Historical Changes dataset</a>).\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric</b>: \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric</b>: \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf the two metrics suggest different transmission levels, the higher level is selected. \n\nTransmission categories include: \n\nLow Transmission Threshold: Counties with fewer than 10 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, and a NAAT percent test positivity in the past 7 days below 5%; \n\nModerate Transmission Threshold: Counties with 10-49 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 5.0-7.99%; \n\nSubstantial Transmission Threshold: Counties with 50-99 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 8.0-9.99%; \n\nHigh Transmission Threshold: Counties with 100 or more total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 10.0% or greater.\n\nBlank : total new cases in the past 7 days are not reported (county data known to be unavailable) and the percentage of positive NAATs tests during the past 7 days (blank) are not reported.\n\n<b>Data Suppression</b>\nTo prevent the release of data tha", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-01T00:03:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:10:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-09-21T19:10:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-01T00:03:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["state_name", "fips_code", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "report_date", "county_name", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_field_name": ["state_name", "fips_code", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "report_date", "county_name", "percent_test_results_reported", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["State", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "County", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-21T17:52:14.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1D"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Geospatial-Resolution", "value": "State, County"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cdc.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/8396-v7yb", "link": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb", "owner": {"id": "aa26-iwd8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Brian Lee"}, "creator": {"id": "aa26-iwd8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Brian Lee"}}

Cause of death counts are based on the underlying cause of death, and presented for Respiratory diseases, Circulatory diseases, Malignant neoplasms, and Alzheimer disease and dementia.

This dataset contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions.  Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. This dataset includes data from January 1, 2021.  Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\nCurrently, CDC provides the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the levels for each county from January 1, 2021 (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">Historical Changes dataset</a>) and a dataset with the levels as originally posted (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb\">Originally Posted dataset</a>), updated daily with the most recent day\u2019s data.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. \n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric</b>: \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric</b>: \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf the two metrics suggest different transmission levels, the higher level is selected. If one metric is missing, the other metric is used for the indicator.  \n\nTransmission categories include: \n\nLow Transmission Threshold: Counties with fewer than 10 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, and a NAAT percent test positivity in the past 7 days below 5%; \n\nModerate Transmission Threshold: Counties with 10-49 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 5.0-7.99%; \n\nSubstantial Transmission Threshold: Counties with 50-99 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 8.0-9.99%; \n\nHigh Transmission Threshold: Counties with 100 or more total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 10.0% or greater.\n\nBlank : total new cases in the past 7 days are not reported (county data known to be unavailable) and the percentage of positive NAATs tests during the past 7 days (blank) are not reported.\n\n<b>Data Suppression</b>\nTo", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-01T00:20:21.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:40:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-01T00:14:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-01T00:20:21.000Z", "columns_name": ["cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "county_name", "state_name", "date", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_field_name": ["cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "county_name", "state_name", "date", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "County", "State", "Week ending date for the 7-day period for the case rate and the percent positivity", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-06T19:05:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["cases", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/8396-v7yb"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1D"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Geospatial-Resolution", "value": "State, County"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cdc.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/nra9-vzzn", "link": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn", "owner": {"id": "aa26-iwd8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Brian Lee"}, "creator": {"id": "aa26-iwd8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Brian Lee"}}

{"resource": {"name": "VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts", "id": "xkb8-kh2a", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.\r\n\r\nThe provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.\r\n\r\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\r\n\r\nTechnical notes\r\n\r\nNature and sources of data\r\n\r\nProvisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\r\n\r\nThe timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.\r\n\r\nProvisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

Mumps to Novel influenza A virus infections - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.
